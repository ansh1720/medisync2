Abortion,"Overview Around 73 million induced abortions take place worldwide each year. Six out of 10 (61%) of all unintended pregnancies, and 3 out of 10 (29%) of all pregnancies, end in induced abortion (1). ",,uterine perforation (caused when the uterus is pierced by a sharp object); and damage to the genital tract and internal organs as a consequence of inserting dangerous objects into the vagina or anus. ,that health workers are supported and protected from stigma; and provision of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies. ,"Comprehensive abortion care is included in the list of essential health care services published by WHO in 2020. Abortion is a simple health care intervention that can be safely and effectively managed by a wide range of health workers using medication or a surgical procedure. In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a medical abortion can also be safely self-managed by the pregnant person outside of a health care facility (e.g. at home), in whole or in part. This requires that the woman has access to accurate information, quality medicines and support from a trained health worker (if she needs or wants it during the process). Comprehensive abortion care includes the provision of information, abortion management and post-abortion care. It encompasses care related to miscarriage (spontaneous abortion and missed abortion), induced abortion (the deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means), incomplete abortion as well as intrauterine fetal demise. ","Consequences of inaccessible quality abortion care Lack of access to safe, affordable, timely and respectful abortion care, and the stigma associated with abortion, pose risks to women’s physical and mental well-being throughout the life-course. "
Abuse of older people,Overview ,,"The abuse of older people, also known as elder abuse, is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect. Scope of the problem ","Prevention Many strategies have been tried to prevent and respond to abuse of older people, but evidence for the effectiveness of most of these interventions is limited at present. Strategies considered most promising include caregiver interventions, which provide services to relieve the burden of caregiving; money management programmes for older adults vulnerable to financial exploitation; helplines and emergency shelters; and multi-disciplinary teams, as the responses required often cut across many systems, including criminal justice, health care, mental health care, adults protective services and long-term care (5). ","Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. However, a review of recent studies on abuse of older people in institutional settings (2) indicates that 64.2% of staff reported perpetrating some form of abuse in the past year. Table 1: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses ","Consequences Abuse of older people can have serious physical and mental health, financial, and social consequences, including, for instance, physical injuries, premature mortality, depression, cognitive decline, financial devastation and placement in nursing homes. For older people, the consequences of abuse can be especially serious and recovery may take longer (4). "
Adolescent and young adult health,"Key facts Over 1.5 million adolescents and young adults aged 10–24 years died in 2021, about 4500 every day. Young adolescents aged 10–14 years have the lowest risk of death among all age groups. Overview ",,"Injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning), interpersonal violence, self-harm and maternal conditions are the leading causes of death among adolescents and young adults. Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 18, but most cases are undetected and untreated. ","Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease, but it continues to impact the lives and development of millions of children and adolescents. Children and young adolescents aged under 15 years represent about 11% of all people with TB globally. This means 1.1 million children and young adolescents aged under 15 years fall ill with TB every year, and more than 225 000 of them lose their lives. Adolescents and young adults usually present with bacteriologically infectious TB characterized by cavities seen on chest x-rays. The Global Tuberculosis Report shows that notification rates in adolescents aged 15–19 years are relatively high compared with younger adolescents. ","One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, the world should ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. Adolescent pregnancy fact sheet ","Many factors have an impact on the well-being and mental health of adolescents. Violence, poverty, stigma, exclusion, and living in humanitarian and fragile settings can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Adolescent mental health fact sheet "
Adolescent pregnancy,"Key facts As of 2019, adolescents aged 15–19 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had an estimated 21 million pregnancies each year, of which approximately 50% were unintended and which resulted in an estimated 12 million births (1,2). Based on 2019 data, 55% of unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years end in abortions, which are often unsafe in LMICs (1). ",,"Adolescent pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social and economic consequences. Globally, the adolescent birth rate (ABR) has decreased, but rates of change have been uneven across regions. There are also enormous variations in levels between and within countries. Adolescent pregnancy tends to be higher among those with less education or of low economic status. Further, there is slower progress in reducing adolescent first births amongst these and other vulnerable groups, leading to increasing inequity. Child marriage and child sexual abuse place girls at increased risk of pregnancy, often unintended. In many places, barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding unintended pregnancies. There is growing attention being paid to improving access to quality maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. WHO works with partners to advocate for attention to adolescent pregnancy, to build an evidence base for action, to develop policy and programme support tools, to build capacity and to support countries to address adolescent pregnancy effectively. Scope of the problem ",Preventing pregnancy among adolescents and pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity are foundational to achieving positive health outcomes across the life course and imperative for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to maternal and newborn health. Overview ,"Strategies and interventions related to adolescent pregnancy have focused on pregnancy prevention. However, there is growing attention being paid to improving access to and quality of maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents. Available data on access paints a mixed picture. Access to quality care depends on the geographic context and the social status of adolescents. Even where access is not limited, adolescents appear to receive a lower quality of both clinical care and interpersonal support than adult women do. WHO response ","Adolescent pregnancy is a global phenomenon with clearly known causes and serious health, social and economic consequences to individuals, families and communities. There is consensus on the evidence-based actions needed to prevent it. There is growing global, regional and national commitment to preventing child marriage and adolescent pregnancy and childbearing. Nongovernmental organizations have led the effort in several countries. In a growing number of countries, governments are taking the lead to put in place large-scale programmes. They challenge and inspire other countries to do what is doable and urgently needs to be done – now. References "
Ageing and health,"Overview People worldwide are living longer. Today most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. Every country in the world is experiencing growth in both the size and the proportion of older persons in the population. By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. By 2050, the world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion). The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million. ",,,,"A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or a long-neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health. Evidence suggests that the proportion of life in good health has remained broadly constant, implying that the additional years are in poor health. If people can experience these extra years of life in good health and if they live in a supportive environment, their ability to do the things they value will be little different from that of a younger person. If these added years are dominated by declines in physical and mental capacity, the implications for older people and for society are more negative. ","At the biological level, ageing results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time. This leads to a gradual decrease in physical and mental capacity, a growing risk of disease and ultimately death. These changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a person’s age in years. The diversity seen in older age is not random. Beyond biological changes, ageing is often associated with other life transitions such as retirement, relocation to more appropriate housing and the death of friends and partners. Common health conditions associated with ageing "
Alcohol,Key facts ,,"Alcohol or alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, a psychoactive and toxic substance that can cause dependence. Worldwide, around 2.6 million deaths were caused by alcohol consumption in 2019. Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300 000 deaths from communicable diseases. ","Effective alcohol control interventions exist and should be utilized more, at the same time it is important for people to know risks associated with alcohol consumption and take individual actions to protect from its harmful effects. Overview ","Based on 2019 data, about 54% out of 145 reporting countries had national guidelines/standards for specialized treatment services for alcohol use disorders, but only 46% of countries had legal regulations to protect the confidentiality of people in treatment. Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders. Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in all countries where such data are available. ","Some groups and individuals who are vulnerable or at risk may have a higher susceptibility to the toxic, psychoactive and dependence-inducing properties of alcohol. On the other hand, individuals who adopt lower-risk patterns of alcohol consumption may not necessarily face a significantly increased likelihood of negative health and social consequences. Societal factors which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and related problems include cultural and social norms, availability of alcohol, level of economic development, and implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies. "
Ambient (outdoor) air pollution,"Key facts Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risks to child health In 2019, 99% of the world’s population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met. ",,"Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. ","Addressing air pollution, which is the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, is key to protecting public health. Most sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and this demands concerted action by local, national and regional level policy-makers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning and agriculture. ","Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in some regions. Overview ","PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. There is strong evidence for the negative health impacts associated with exposure to this pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. Carbon monoxide (CO) "
Anaemia,Overview Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. It mainly affects women and children. Anaemia occurs when there isn’t enough haemoglobin in the body to carry oxygen to the organs and tissues. ,"Signs and symptoms Anaemia causes symptoms such as fatigue, reduced physical work capacity, and shortness of breath. Anaemia is an indicator of poor nutrition and other health problems. ","In severe cases, anaemia can cause poor cognitive and motor development in children. It can also cause problems for pregnant women and their babies. Anaemia can be caused by poor nutrition, infections, chronic diseases, heavy menstruation, pregnancy issues and family history. It is often caused by a lack of iron in the blood. ","Anaemia is preventable and treatable. In many low- and lower-middle income settings, the most commonly- recognized causes of anaemia are iron deficiency and malaria. ","Infections can be another important cause of anaemia, depending on the local burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Infections can impair nutrient absorption and metabolism (e.g. malaria, ascariasis) or can cause nutrient loss (e.g. schistosomiasis, hookworm infection). Many different chronic conditions can cause inflammation and lead to anaemia of inflammation or anaemia of chronic disease. HIV infection causes anaemia through a wide range of mechanisms including ineffective production or excessive destruction of red blood cells, blood loss, and side effects of the drug treatment. Consistent heavy menstrual losses, maternal blood volume expansion during pregnancy, and blood loss during and after childbirth, particularly in cases of postpartum haemorrhage, commonly lead to anaemia. ","Global impact The consequences of anaemia can vary. It can affect school performance (through developmental delays and behavioural disturbances such as decreased motor activity, social interaction and attention to tasks), productivity in adult life and overall quality of life in general.  During pregnancy, anaemia has been associated with poor maternal and birth outcomes, including premature birth, low birth weight and maternal mortality. In addition to the health consequences, anaemia can have important financial impacts for individuals, families, communities and countries. It is estimated that for every US$ 1 invested in reducing anaemia in women, US$ 12 in economic returns could potentially be produced (2). "
Animal bites,Key facts Overview ,"Treatment depends on the animal species, bite location, clinical symptoms and allergic reaction of the bite victim. The main principles of care include: early medical management; ","Bites by animals carrying venoms, toxins and pathogens are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Globally, up to 5 million people are bitten by snakes annually, with nearly 50% of them ending up with envenomation – mostly in Africa and South-East Asia – necessitating prompt medical intervention with appropriate antivenom. ",Prevention of snake bites and their serious health consequences Prevention of snake bites involves informing communities about snake bite risks and prevention techniques including wearing protective shoes/boots; keep storage areas clear of rodents; raise beds above floor level; and tucking mosquito nets securely under sleeping mats. ,"The health impacts of animal bites vary with the type and health of the animal species, the size and health of the bitten person, and accessibility to appropriate health care. Paediatric cases are of particular concern related to animal bite injuries, with over half of the victims being children. While numerous animal species have the potential to bite humans, incidents involving domestic animals are significantly more prevalent than those involving wildlife, and subsequent infections from wounds can lead to severe illness or even death. In general, the key to better outcomes related to animal bites is timely presentation of the bitten person for appropriate medical attention and accurately identifying the animal attacked. Animals of common concern: ","Dog bite fatality rates are higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries because dog-mediated rabies viral infection, and there may be a lack of post-exposure treatment and appropriate access to health care. An estimated 59 000 people die annually from rabies, and bites from rabid dogs account for majority of these deaths. While rabies is vaccine preventable and post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered soon after exposure to save lives, once signs of rabies appear, there is no treatment and the consequences are fatal. Who is most at risk? "
Antimicrobial resistance,"Key facts Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats. It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths (1). The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. ",,"The global rise in antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat, diminishing the efficacy of common antibiotics against widespread bacterial infections. The 2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report highlights alarming resistance rates among prevalent bacterial pathogens.  Median reported rates in 76 countries of 42% for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and 35% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are a major concern. For urinary tract infections caused by E. coli, 1 in 5 cases exhibited reduced susceptibility to standard antibiotics like ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and fluoroquinolones in 2020. This is making it harder to effectively treat common infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common intestinal bacterium, also showed elevated resistance levels against critical antibiotics. Increased levels of resistance potentially lead to heightened utilization of last-resort drugs like carbapenems, for which resistance is in turn being observed across multiple regions. As the effectiveness of these last-resort drugs is compromised, the risks increase of infections that cannot be treated. Projections by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicate an anticipated twofold surge in resistance to last-resort antibiotics by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, underscoring the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship practices and enhanced surveillance coverage worldwide. ","Priorities to address AMR in human health include preventing all infections, which may result in inappropriate use of antimicrobials; ensuring universal access to quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; and strategic information and innovation, for example surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption/use, and research and development for novel vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. Overview ","AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. ","AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected. AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier. "
Anxiety disorders,"Key facts Anxiety disorders are the world’s most common mental disorders, affecting 301 million people in 2019. More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men. ",Symptoms of anxiety often have onset during childhood or adolescence. There are highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders. ,"Everyone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive. These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms. They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a person’s family, social and school or working life. An estimated 4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder (1). In 2019, 301 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders (1). ","Contributing factors and prevention Anxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one. ",Approximately 1 in 4 people with anxiety disorders receive treatment for this condition. Overview ,"Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions. Effective community based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents. Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults. "
Arsenic,"Overview Arsenic is a natural component of the earth’s crust and is widely distributed throughout the environment in the air, water and land. It is highly toxic in its inorganic form. People are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water, using contaminated water in food preparation and irrigation of food crops, industrial processes, eating contaminated food and smoking tobacco. ","The immediate symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. These are followed by numbness and tingling of the extremities, muscle cramping and death, in extreme cases. Long-term effects ",People who smoke tobacco can also be exposed to the natural inorganic arsenic content of tobacco because tobacco plants can take up arsenic naturally present in the soil. The potential for elevated arsenic exposure was much greater in the past when tobacco plants were treated with lead arsenate insecticide. Health effects ,"Prevention and control The most important action in affected communities is the prevention of further exposure to arsenic by the provision of a safe water supply for drinking, food preparation and irrigation of food crops. There are a number of options to reduce levels of arsenic in drinking-water. ","Arsenic is one of WHO’s 10 chemicals of major public health concern. WHO’s work to reduce arsenic exposure includes setting guideline values, reviewing evidence and providing risk management recommendations. WHO publishes a guideline value for arsenic in its Guidelines for drinking-water quality. The Guidelines are intended for use as the basis for regulation and standard setting worldwide. The current recommended limit of arsenic in drinking-water is 10 μg/L, although this guideline value is designated as provisional because of practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water. Every effort should therefore be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible and below the guideline value when resources are available. ","Arsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality, with impacts on child health (1), and exposure in utero and in early childhood has been linked to increases in mortality in young adults due to multiple cancers, lung disease, heart attacks and kidney failure (2). Numerous studies have demonstrated negative impacts of arsenic exposure on cognitive development, intelligence and memory (3). Magnitude of the problem "
Asbestos,"Key facts All forms of asbestos, including chrysotile, are carcinogenic to humans. Systematic review evidence indicates that a substantial proportion of manual workers in the construction industry globally are exposed to asbestos. Overview ",,"Globally, more than 200 000 deaths are estimated to be caused by occupational exposure to asbestos – more than 70% of all deaths from work-related cancers. The use of asbestos has been prohibited in more than 50 WHO Member States. ","Asbestos-related diseases can be prevented, and the most efficient way to prevent them is to stop the use of all forms of asbestos to prevent exposure, as more than 50 WHO Member States have already done through legal measures, and to use low hazard materials instead. Preventing asbestos exposure also means protecting workers during maintenance work where asbestos is already in place, and during asbestos removal. Why is asbestos a problem? ","Asbestos-related diseases can be prevented, and the most efficient way to prevent them is to stop the use of all forms of asbestos to prevent exposure. More than 50 WHO Member States have legislated to prohibit the use of asbestos. Decisions to take legislative action have considered a range of costs and benefits, including the costs of providing healthcare and the loss of workforce productivity, in addition to conventional economic and trade considerations. Preventing asbestos exposure also means protecting workers during maintenance work where asbestos is in place, and during asbestos removal. Challenges ","Impact According to WHO and the International Labour Organization (latest WHO/ILO Joint Estimates), exposure to asbestos at work causes more than 200 000 deaths globally every year (based on estimates for 2016). This represents over 70% of deaths from work-related cancers. In addition to this estimate of mortality, exposure to asbestos is also estimated to cause a substantial burden of ill health (loss of nearly 4 million disability-adjusted life years – a standardized measure of ill-health). A substantial level of deaths and ill health are also attributed to exposure to asbestos outside the workplace. It has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibres substantially increases the risk for lung cancer – and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk. "
Assistive technology,Key facts Overview ,,,"therapeutic footwear for diabetes reduces the incidence of foot ulcers, preventing amputations and the associated impact on individuals and burden on health-care systems; and timely provision of assistive technology for older people can improve their independence and safety as well as enable them to live at home for as long as possible. ","Assistive products can range from physical products such as wheelchairs, glasses, prosthetic limbs, white canes, and hearing aids to digital solutions such as speech recognition or time management software and captioning. Most people who use assistive technology use more than one product, making integrated services important. ","Assistive technology can positively impact a person, their family and friends, and has broader socioeconomic benefits. For example: early provision of hearing aids for young children supports their development of language and communication skills, limiting negative impacts on their education, future employment and community participation; "
Asthma,Overview ,"Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time. Although asthma can be a serious condition, it can be managed with the right treatment. People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional. ","Asthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time. ",Asthma is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for asthma in a number of ways. ,"People with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death. Symptoms ","Impact Asthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. "
Autism,"Overview Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a diverse group of conditions. They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations. ",,"Causes Available scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors that make a child more likely to have autism, including environmental and genetic factors. ","People with autism require accessible health services for general health-care needs like the rest of the population, including promotive and preventive services and treatment of acute and chronic illness. Nevertheless, autistic people have higher rates of unmet health-care needs compared with the general population. They are also more vulnerable during humanitarian emergencies. A common barrier is created by health-care providers’ inadequate knowledge and understanding of autism. WHO resolution on autism spectrum disorders ","The abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require life-long care and support. Autism often has an impact on education and employment opportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant. Societal attitudes and the level of support provided by local and national authorities are important factors determining the quality of life of people with autism. Characteristics of autism may be detected in early childhood, but autism is often not diagnosed until much later. ",
Bacterial vaginosis,Key facts Overview ,Signs and symptoms Some women with BV may not notice any symptoms whereas others might express: ,Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginal discharge among women of reproductive age. It is treatable and curable. ,"The exact cause of BV is not known. While many “good” bacteria are normally found in the healthy vagina, BV results from an imbalance between “good” and “harmful” bacteria micro-organisms. More specifically, an overgrowth of pathogens such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella spp., Mobilincus spp., Megaspahera spp., Sneathea spp. and mixed vaginal anaerobes species would eventually replace the “beneficial” lactobacilli that helps maintain a healthy vaginal environment. The exact cause of this imbalance is not known but has been attributed to douching and having unprotected sex with a new or several sex partners. Signs and symptoms ","Although it occurs globally, it is more common in low-resource settings and areas with limited access to healthcare. The exact cause of BV is not known. While many “good” bacteria are normally found in the healthy vagina, BV results from an imbalance between “good” and “harmful” bacteria micro-organisms. More specifically, an overgrowth of pathogens such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella spp., Mobilincus spp., Megaspahera spp., Sneathea spp. and mixed vaginal anaerobes species would eventually replace the “beneficial” lactobacilli that helps maintain a healthy vaginal environment. The exact cause of this imbalance is not known but has been attributed to douching and having unprotected sex with a new or several sex partners. ","WHO works with partners and Member States to reduce the burden of bacterial vaginosis globally. This work includes developing research and evidence to better understand the epidemiology, burden and impact of BV, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In 2021, the Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STIs Programmes at WHO published Guidelines for the management of symptomatic sexually transmitted infections to provide updated, evidence-informed clinical and practical recommendations on case management of people with STIs.

Biodiversity,"Key facts More than 75% of global food crops rely on pollinators, contributing US$ 235–577 billion annually to global agricultural output. Over 50% of modern medicines are derived from natural sources, including antibiotics from fungi and painkillers from plant compounds. ",,"People depend on biodiversity in many ways. Human health relies on ecosystem resources, products and services (such as fresh water, food and fuel sources; the regulation of crop pests and diseases; and the regulation of air, water and soil quality) which are needed for good health and productive livelihoods. Biodiversity loss can have significant direct health impacts if ecosystem services no longer meet societal needs. Changes in ecosystems can affect livelihoods, income, local migration and may even cause or increase political conflict. Significant medical and pharmacological discoveries are made through greater understanding of the Earth's biodiversity. Biological diversity of microorganisms, flora and fauna provides extensive benefits for biological, health, and pharmacological sciences. It is also the source of traditional and complementary medicines. ","Indigenous Peoples, representing an estimated 6% of the global population, are crucial stakeholders and rights holders in the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. They manage over 38 million square kilometres of land globally, which includes nearly 40% of all protected areas. Overview ","Biodiversity loss also has profound economic consequences, particularly in sectors like agriculture, fisheries and healthcare. It is estimated that the global economic impact of biodiversity loss amounts to US$ 10 trillion annually, including healthcare costs from increased disease transmission and agricultural losses from pollinator declines. For example, the decline in bee populations, which are responsible for pollinating crops worth over US$ 235 billion annually, threatens global food security and nutrition. Threats to biodiversity and health ","Impact People depend on biodiversity in many ways. Human health relies on ecosystem resources, products and services (such as fresh water, food and fuel sources; the regulation of crop pests and diseases; and the regulation of air, water and soil quality) which are needed for good health and productive livelihoods. Biodiversity loss can have significant direct health impacts if ecosystem services no longer meet societal needs. Changes in ecosystems can affect livelihoods, income, local migration and may even cause or increase political conflict. "
Bipolar disorder,"Key facts Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects a person’s mood, energy, activity and thought and is characterized by manic (or hypomanic) and depressive episodes. An estimated 40 million people live with bipolar disorder worldwide. ",Symptoms and patterns Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by mood swings from one extreme to another. ,"Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care. On average, people with bipolar disorder die more than 10 years earlier than the general population (2). ","Both manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school. They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others. Some people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the person’s ability to function to the same extent. ","There are a range of effective care options, which combine medicines and psychosocial interventions to help people with bipolar disorder stay well. Overview ",
Blindness and vision impairment,"Overview Vision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every facet and stage of our lives. We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work. ","Treatment is also available for many eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, but generate discomfort and pain. Treatment of these conditions is directed at alleviating the symptoms and preventing the evolution towards more severe stages of those diseases. Vision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration. ","Vision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract or refractive error – are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment – such as dry eye or conjunctivitis – must not be overlooked. These conditions are frequently among the leading reasons for presentation to eye care services. Causes ","Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Among this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) (1). The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million) (2). ","Vision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions.

Blood safety and availability,"National blood policy and organization *Data source: This fact sheet is based on data obtained through the WHO Global Database on Blood Safety from 108 countries for the year 2018. To give a more complete overview of the global situation, data for the year 2017 have been used for 40 countries and data for the year 2015 have been used for 23 countries, where current data are not available. Overall, responses received from 171 countries cover 97.5 % of the world’s population. ",,,"World Health Assembly resolution WHA63.12 urges Member States to establish, implement and support nationally coordinated, efficiently managed and sustainable blood and plasma programmes, according to the availability of resources, with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency. It is the responsibility of individual governments to ensure sufficient and equitable supply of plasma-derived medicinal products, namely immunoglobulins and coagulation factors, which are needed to prevent and treat a variety of serious conditions that occur worldwide. Only 56 of 171 reporting countries produce plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMP) through the fractionation of plasma collected in the reporting country. A total of 91 countries reported that all PDMP are imported, 16 countries reported that no PDMP were used during the reporting period, and 8 countries did not respond to the question. ","Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. Providing safe and adequate blood should be an integral part of every country’s national health care policy and infrastructure. WHO recommends that all activities related to blood collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution be coordinated at the national level through effective organization and integrated blood supply networks. The national blood system should be governed by national blood policy and legislative framework to promote uniform implementation of standards and consistency in the quality and safety of blood and blood products. ","The risk of transmission of serious infections, including HIV and hepatitis, through unsafe blood and chronic blood shortages brought global attention to the importance of blood safety and availability. With the goal of ensuring universal access to safe blood and blood products, WHO has been at the forefront to improve blood safety and availability, and recommends the following integrated strategy for blood safety and availability: Establishment of a national blood system with well-organized and coordinated blood transfusion services, effective evidence-based and ethical national blood policies, and legislation and regulation, that can provide sufficient and timely supplies of safe blood and blood products to meet the transfusion needs of all patients.

Botulism,Overview ,"Symptoms of foodborne botulism Botulinum toxins are neurotoxic and therefore affect the nervous system. Foodborne botulism is characterized by descending, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory failure. Early symptoms include marked fatigue, weakness and vertigo, usually followed by blurred vision, dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing and speaking. Vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal swelling may also occur. The disease can progress to weakness in the neck and arms, after which the respiratory muscles and muscles of the lower body are affected. There is no fever and no loss of consciousness. ","Foodborne botulism is a serious, potentially fatal disease. However, it is relatively rare. It is an intoxication usually caused by ingestion of potent neurotoxins, the botulinum toxins, formed in contaminated foods. Person to person transmission of botulism does not occur. Spores produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum are heat-resistant and exist widely in the environment, and in the absence of oxygen they germinate, grow and then excrete toxins. There are 7 distinct forms of botulinum toxin, types A–G. Four of these (types A, B, E and rarely F) cause human botulism. Types C, D and E cause illness in other mammals, birds and fish. ","C. botulinum will not grow in acidic conditions (pH less than 4.6), and therefore the toxin will not be formed in acidic foods (however, a low pH will not degrade any pre-formed toxin). Combinations of low storage temperature and salt contents and/or pH are also used to prevent the growth of the bacteria or the formation of the toxin. The botulinum toxin has been found in a variety of foods, including low-acid preserved vegetables, such as green beans, spinach, mushrooms, and beets; fish, including canned tuna, fermented, salted and smoked fish; and meat products, such as ham and sausage. The food implicated differs between countries and reflects local eating habits and food preservation procedures. Occasionally, commercially prepared foods are involved. ","The symptoms are not caused by the bacterium itself, but by the toxin produced by the bacterium. Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 36 hours (within a minimum and maximum range of 4 hours to 8 days) after exposure. Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment (early administration of antitoxin and intensive respiratory care) are not given. The disease can be fatal in 5 to 10% of cases. Exposure and transmission ",
Breast cancer,Key facts Overview ,Signs and symptoms Most people will not experience any symptoms when the cancer is still early hence the importance of early detection. ,Breast cancer caused 670 000 deaths globally in 2022. Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age. ,"Certain inherited high penetrance gene mutations greatly increase breast cancer risk, the most dominant being mutations in the genes BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB-2. Women found to have mutations in these major genes may consider risk reduction strategies such as surgical removal of both breasts or chemoprevention strategies. Signs and symptoms ","Treatment is based on the person, the type of cancer and its spread. Treatment combines surgery, radiation therapy and medications. Scope of the problem ",Global impact Age-standardized breast cancer mortality in high-income countries dropped by 40% between the 1980s and 2020 (1). Countries that have succeeded in reducing breast cancer mortality have been able to achieve an annual breast cancer mortality reduction of 2–4% per year. 
Brucellosis,Who is at risk? ,"Brucellosis typically causes flu-like symptoms, including fever, weakness, malaise and weight loss. However, the disease may present in many atypical forms. In many patients the symptoms are mild and, therefore, the diagnosis may not be considered. The incubation period of the disease can be highly variable, ranging from 1 week to 2 months, but usually 2–4 weeks. Treatment options include doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 45 days, plus streptomycin 1 g daily for 15 days. The main alternative therapy is doxycycline at 100 mg, twice a day for 45 days, plus rifampicin at 15mg/kg/day (600-900mg) for 45 days. Experience suggests that streptomycin may be substituted with gentamicin 5mg/kg/daily for 7–10 days, but no study directly comparing the two regimes is currently available. The optimal treatment for pregnant women, neonates and children under 8 is not yet determined; for children, options include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) combined with an aminoglycoside (streptomycin, gentamycin) or rifampicin. ","Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various Brucella species, which mainly infect cattle, swine, goats, sheep and dogs. Humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals, by eating or drinking contaminated animal products or by inhaling airborne agents. Most cases are caused by ingesting unpasteurized milk or cheese from infected goats or sheep. Brucellosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses transmitted by animals and in endemic areas, human brucellosis has serious public health consequences. Expansion of animal industries and urbanization, and the lack of hygienic measures in animal husbandry and in food handling, partly account for brucellosis remaining a public health hazard. ","Prevention and control Prevention of brucellosis is based on surveillance and the prevention of risk factors. The most effective prevention strategy is the elimination of infection in animals. Vaccination of cattle, goats and sheep is recommended in enzootic areas with high prevalence rates. Serological or other testing and culling can also be effective in areas with low prevalence. In countries where eradication in animals through vaccination or elimination of infected animals is not feasible, prevention of human infection is primarily based on raising awareness, food-safety measures, occupational hygiene and laboratory safety. ","Treatment and care Brucellosis typically causes flu-like symptoms, including fever, weakness, malaise and weight loss. However, the disease may present in many atypical forms. In many patients the symptoms are mild and, therefore, the diagnosis may not be considered. The incubation period of the disease can be highly variable, ranging from 1 week to 2 months, but usually 2–4 weeks. ",
Burns,Key facts ,,An estimated 180 000 deaths every year are caused by burns. The vast majority occur in low- and middle-income countries. Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity. ,Burns are preventable. Overview ,"Direct care costs for burns vary widely but tend towards being generally expensive with a 2014 systematic review finding a mean total healthcare cost per burn patient of US$ 88 218 (range US$ 704–717 306). In South Africa an estimated US$ 26 million is spent annually for care of burns from kerosene (paraffin) cookstove incidents. Indirect costs such as lost wages, prolonged care for deformities and emotional trauma, and commitment of family resources, also contribute to the socioeconomic impact. ",Economic impact Direct care costs for burns vary widely but tend towards being generally expensive with a 2014 systematic review finding a mean total healthcare cost per burn patient of US$ 88 218 (range US$ 704–717 306). 
Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection),Overview ,"Signs and symptoms Buruli ulcer often starts as a painless swelling (nodule), a large painless area of induration (plaque) or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face (oedema). The disease may progress with no pain and fever. Without treatment or sometimes during antibiotics treatment, the nodule, plaque or oedema will ulcerate within 4 weeks. Bone is occasionally affected, causing deformities. ","Buruli ulcer is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium ulcerans. The bacterium produces a toxin that causes the skin damage. Without early treatment, Buruli ulcer can  lead to long-term disability. The germ that causes Buruli ulcer belongs to the same family of those that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. It is still unclear how people get Buruli ulcer from the environment. Scope of the problem ","Interventions such as wound and lymphoedema management and surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting) are used to speed up healing, thereby shortening the duration of hospitalization. Physiotherapy is needed in severe cases to prevent disability. Those left with disability require long-term rehabilitation. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis. Prevention and control ","Lesions frequently occur in the limbs: 35% on the upper limbs, 55% on the lower limbs, and 10% on the other parts of the body. Health workers should be careful in the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in patients with lower leg lesions to avoid confusion with other causes of ulceration such as diabetes, arterial and venous insufficiency lesion. Diagnosis ",
Campylobacter,"Campylobacter are mainly spiral-shaped, “S”-shaped, or curved, rod-shaped bacteria. Currently, there are 17 species and 6 subspecies assigned to the genus Campylobacter, of which the most frequently reported in human diseases are C. jejuni (subspecies jejuni) and C. coli. Other species such as C. lari and C. upsaliensis have also been isolated from patients with diarrhoeal disease, but are reported less frequently. ","The onset of disease symptoms usually occurs 2 to 5 days after infection with the bacteria, but can range from 1 to 10 days. The most common clinical symptoms of Campylobacter infections include diarrhoea (frequently bloody), abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. The symptoms typically last 3 to 6 days. ","The burden of foodborne diseases, including Campylobacteriosis, is substantial: every year almost 1 in 10 people fall ill and 33 million of healthy life years are lost. Foodborne diseases can be severe, especially for young children. Diarrhoeal diseases are the most common illnesses resulting from unsafe food, with 550 million people falling ill yearly (including 220 million children under the age of 5 years). Campylobacter is 1 of the 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases. The high incidence of Campylobacter diarrhoea, as well as its duration and possible complications, makes it highly important from a socio-economic perspective. In developing countries, Campylobacter infections in children under the age of 2 years are especially frequent, sometimes resulting in death. ",Prevention methods There are a number of strategies that can be used to prevent disease from Campylobacter: ,"Treatment Treatment is not generally required, except electrolyte replacement and rehydration. Antimicrobial treatment is recommended in invasive cases (when bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa cells and damage the tissues) or to eliminate the carrier state (the condition of people who harbour Campylobacter in their bodies and keep shedding the bacteria while remaining asymptomatic). ","Estimating the importance of all known sources is therefore extremely difficult. In addition, the wide occurrence of Campylobacter also hinders the development of control strategies throughout the food chain. However, in countries where specific strategies have been put in place to reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter in live poultry, a similar reduction in human cases is observed. Treatment "
Cancer,Key facts Overview ,being aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice when abnormal findings are observed; access to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; and ,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in six deaths. The most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum and prostate cancers. ",Between 30 and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. Prevention ,ensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care (for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes); minimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; and ,
Candidiasis (yeast infection),Key facts Overview ,"Candidiasis, also known as a yeast infection, is a fungal infection primarily caused by Candida yeasts. Many of these yeasts are normally present in the human body as part of the natural microbiome, or in the surrounding environment, often without causing any problems. However, when conditions allow, such as a weakened immune system or changes in the body's natural environment (e.g., due to hormonal changes, antibiotic use or other reasons), Candida can overgrow and cause an infection. Candidiasis can affect various parts of the body, leading to a range of symptoms. Common types of candidiasis include vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infection), which affects the vagina; oral candidiasis (thrush), which affects the mouth and throat; and invasive candidiasis, which is a serious systemic infection that can affect any organ in the body. Invasive candidiasis is a significant concern in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. ","Candidiasis is a common fungal infection mostly caused by yeasts of the Candida species. Candidiasis can affect various parts of the body, including the mouth (oral candidiasis or thrush), vagina (vaginal candidiasis), oesophagus, skin and bloodstream (invasive candidiasis). ","While generally treatable with antifungal medications, some types can be hard to treat. For example, Candida auris is a multi-drug-resistant fungal species that has been responsible for outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Prevention and proper management are crucial to reduce the risk and spread of these infections. Vaginal yeast infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis) ","Candidiasis can be treated with antifungal medications. Treatment can be more complex when infections are caused by drug-resistant species. Candida auris is a fungal species that can be multi-drug resistant, cause invasive disease and lead to hospital outbreaks. ",
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs),Key facts Overview ,What are common symptoms of cardiovascular diseases? Symptoms of heart attacks and strokes ,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. ","Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural and environmental risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and air pollution. It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin. ","The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst environmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications. Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.

Cervical cancer,Key facts Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally with around 660 000 new cases and around 350 000 deaths in 2022. Overview ,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection which can affect the skin, genital area and throat. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms. In most cases the immune system clears HPV from the body. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer. Persistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina – also called the birth canal) if left untreated, causes 95% of cervical cancers. Typically, it takes 15–20 years for abnormal cells to become cancer, but in women with weakened immune systems, such as untreated HIV, this process can be faster and take 5–10 years. Risk factors for cancer progression include the grade of oncogenicity of the HPV type, immune status, the presence of other sexually transmitted infections, number of births, young age at first pregnancy, hormonal contraceptive use, and smoking. ",Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV).  Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women without HIV. Prophylactic vaccination against HPV and screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions are effective strategies to prevent cervical cancer and are very cost-effective. ,"Prevention Boosting public awareness, access to information and services are key to prevention and control across the life course. ","The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in low- and middle-income countries. This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services and social and economic determinants. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV).  Women living with HIV are 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer compared to women without HIV. ",
Chagas disease (also known as American trypanosomiasis),Key facts ,"Signs and symptoms Chagas disease presents in two phases. The initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. Although a high number of parasites can circulate in the blood, in most cases symptoms are absent or mild and non-specific (fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain). Much less frequently, people bitten by a triatomine bug show characteristic first visible signs, which can be either a skin lesion (chagoma) or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña’s sign). ","More than 7 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America, are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. It can be transmitted by the triatomine bug (vector-borne), as well as orally (food-borne), during pregnancy or birth (congenital), through blood/blood products, organ transplantation and laboratory accidents. ","Chagas disease is curable if antiparasitic treatment is initiated early, in the acute phase. In chronic infection, the treatment and follow up can potentially prevent or curb disease progression and prevent transmission, for instance, during pregnancy and birth. Without early diagnosis and treatment, up to a third of people with chronic infection develop cardiac alterations and 1 in 10 develop digestive, neurological or mixed alterations which may require specific treatment. ","Key strategies to prevent Chagas disease include vector control (in Latin America); blood screening prior transfusion and transplantation; testing and treating girls, women of reproductive age, newborns and siblings of mothers with the infection; earliest possible diagnosis and comprehensive follow-up and health care; and information, education and communication for communities and health professionals. Overview ",
Chikungunya,Key facts Overview ,"The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue and Zika, making chikungunya easy to misdiagnose and making it more difficult for countries to accurately determine the number of people infected. Chikungunya causes fever and severe joint pain, which is often debilitating and may be prolonged; other symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. ","Chikungunya is a disease caused by the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, with large outbreaks and sporadic cases reported mostly in the Americas, Asia and Africa, and occasional smaller outbreaks in Europe. The symptoms of chikungunya are similar to those of dengue and Zika, making chikungunya easy to misdiagnose and making it more difficult for countries to accurately determine the number of people infected. ","Prevention and control Avoidance of mosquito bites offers the best protection against CHIKV infection. Patients suspected of having CHIKV infection should avoid getting mosquito bites during the first week of illness to prevent further transmission to mosquitoes, that may in turn infect other people. ",There is no specific antiviral treatment for chikungunya virus infections but antipyretic and analgesic medications (such as paracetamol) for fever and pain can be used to alleviate these symptoms. Severe symptoms and deaths from chikungunya are rare and usually occur in young babies or elderly people with other coexisting health problems. ,
Child maltreatment,"Key facts Several risk factors for child maltreatment have been identified. Not all risk factors are present in all social and cultural contexts, and the list here provides an overview when attempting to understand the causes of child maltreatment. ",,"Every year, there are an estimated 40 150 homicide deaths in children under 18 years of age, some of which are likely due to child maltreatment. This number almost certainly underestimates the true extent of the problem, since a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes. In armed conflict and refugee settings, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by combatants, security forces, members of their communities, aid workers and others. ","Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible. Effective prevention approaches include supporting parents, teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. Overview ",Six in 10 children – or 400 million children – under 5 years of age regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers (1). One in 5 women and 1 in 7 men report having been sexually abused as a child (2). ,"Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and the social and occupational outcomes can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development. Child maltreatment is often hidden. Only a fraction of child victims of maltreatment ever get support from health professionals. "
Child mortality (under 5 years),"Overview Substantial global progress has been made in reducing childhood mortality since 1990. The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5 million in 2020. Since 1990, the global under-5 mortality rate has dropped by 60%, from 93 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 37 in 2020. This is equivalent to 1 in 11 children dying before reaching age 5 in 1990, compared to 1 in 27 in 2020. While the global under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) fell to 37 (35–­­40) deaths per 1000 live births in 2020, children in sub-Saharan Africa continued to have the highest rates of mortality in the world at 74 (68–­­86) deaths per 1000 live births- 14 times higher than the risk for children in Europe and North America. ",,"Globally, infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, along with pre-term birth complications, birth asphyxia and trauma and congenital anomalies remain the leading causes of death for children under 5 years.  Access to basic lifesaving interventions such as skilled delivery at birth, postnatal care, breastfeeding and adequate nutrition, vaccinations and treatment for common childhood diseases can save many young lives. Malnourished children, particularly those with severe acute malnutrition, have a higher risk of death from common childhood illness such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria. Nutrition-related factors contribute to about 45% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. ","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, were developed to promote healthy lives and well-being for all children. The SDG Goal 3.2.1 is to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children by 2030. There are two targets: reduce newborn mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births in every country; and ","Data from civil registration and vital statistic systems (CRVS), health management information systems (HMIS) from 80 countries as well as specific country-wide monitoring systems (Mozambique and South Africa) indicate no significant deviation from expected mortality for this age group for 2020 and in some cases indicate fewer deaths than would be expected from historical data. As more data comes in from countries, and further analyses are performed, these results may change for 2021. Global response: Sustainable Development Goal 3.2.1 ",
Childhood cancer,"Key facts Each year, an estimated 400 000 children and adolescents of 0–19 years old develop cancer (1). The most common types of childhood cancer include leukemias, brain tumours, lymphomas, and solid tumours such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour. Overview ","awareness of symptoms by families and primary care providers; accurate and timely clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and staging (determining the extent to which a cancer has spread); and ","Cancer is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents. The likelihood of surviving a diagnosis of childhood cancer depends on the country in which the child lives; in high-income countries, more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many LMICs less than 30% are cured (2). Although childhood cancer cannot generally be prevented or identified through screening, most types of childhood cancer can be cured with generic medicines and other forms of treatment, including surgery and radiotherapy. ","Cancer occurs in people of all ages and can affect any part of the body. It begins with genetic change in single cells, that can then grow into a mass (or tumour), invade other parts of the body and cause harm and death if left untreated. Unlike cancer in adults, most childhood cancers do not have a known cause. Many studies have sought to identify the causes of childhood cancer, but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors. Cancer prevention efforts in children should focus on behaviours that will prevent the child from developing preventable cancer as an adult. Some chronic infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and malaria, are risk factors for childhood cancer. They are particularly relevant in LMICs. Other infections can increase a child’s risk of developing cancer as an adult, so it is important to be vaccinated (against hepatitis B to help prevent liver cancer and against human papillomavirus to help prevent cervical cancer) and to other pursue other methods such as early detection and treatment of chronic infections that can lead to cancer. ","Avoidable deaths from childhood cancers in LMICs result from lack of diagnosis, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, obstacles to accessing care, abandonment of treatment, death from toxicity and relapse (2). Only 29% of low-income countries report that cancer medicines are generally available to their populations compared to 96% of high-income countries. ",Current data suggest that approximately 10% of all children with cancer have a predisposition because of genetic factors (3). Further research is needed to identify factors impacting cancer development in children. Improving outcomes of childhood cancer 
Chlamydia,Key facts Overview ,"Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic; however, when symptoms do occur, they may include unusual urethral and vaginal discharge. If left untreated, chlamydia infection can lead to serious health problems including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women. Chlamydial infection also increases the risk of HIV infection and has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. ","Chlamydia is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which is primarily transmitted through vaginal, oral and anal sex. In 2020 there were an estimated 128.5 million new chlamydia infections among adults (15–49 years old) globally. ",Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia. Scope of the problem ,"Chlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early. However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs. If not treated, chlamydia can cause serious problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease and an increased risk of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity) or with low birth weight. Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia. ",
Cholera,Key facts ,"Most people with cholera have no or mild symptoms and can be treated with oral rehydration solution. Severe cases need intravenous fluids, oral rehydration solution and antibiotics. Population’s access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is essential to prevent cholera. ","Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases. Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics. ",The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) can help prevent and control cholera. Overview ,Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease that can be fatal within hours if not treated. Quick access to treatment is crucial. Researchers estimate that there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths from cholera worldwide each year (1). ,"Community engagement is essential for effectively communicating the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, precautions to take to avoid cholera, when and where to report cases, and the importance of seeking immediate treatment if symptoms appear. Oral cholera vaccines "
Chromoblastomycosis,Key Facts ,Signs and symptoms Chromoblastomycosis presents with wart-like lesions on exposed areas of the skin such as the legs or forearms. These can exceed 10 centimetres in diameter. ,"Chromoblastomycosis is an infection under the skin caused by fungi. It occurs sporadically in tropical and subtropical climates, and its global incidence is unknown. ",,Safe and effective antifungal medicines are available for treatment. Overview ,"Global impact The largest number of cases of chromoblastomycosis has occurred in Central America and northern South America, Africa, China and the West Pacific. Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Madagascar and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) have reported the most cases. The global incidence of chromoblastomycosis is unknown. "
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),Key facts Overview ,"In people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm. Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness. Smoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD. People with COPD are at higher risk of other health problems. ","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.5 million deaths in 2021, approximately 5% of all global deaths. Nearly 90% of COPD deaths in those under 70 years of age occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). ","COPD is not curable but symptoms can improve if one avoids smoking and exposure to air pollution and gets vaccines to prevent infections. It can also be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation. Symptoms ","Common symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment. COPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways. COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.

Civil registration and vital statistics,"Key facts It is estimated that 36 million babies born each year are not registered, as only about 50% of countries have the capacity to register at least 90% of births. Registered births ranged from 98% in the WHO European Region, 96% in the Region of the Americas, 91% in Western Pacific Region, 78% in South-East Asia Region, 69% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and only 44% in African Region. Overview ",,"Nearly 40% of the world’s deaths are not registered, and only 8% of reported deaths in low-income countries have documented causes. The latest global assessment of health data capacity in countries (SCORE assessment) in 164 countries found that the percentage of registered deaths ranged from 98% in the WHO European Region, 91% in the Region of the Americas, 82% in the Western Pacific Region, 61% in South-East Asia Region, 55% in Eastern Mediterranean Region and 10% in African Region (1). ","Many barriers still prevent people from registering births and deaths, including when countries do not have the necessary laws or infrastructure to register all births and deaths. Censuses and surveys can be used to estimate population numbers, but these are not designed to capture information on all causes of death. Some countries have set up sample registration systems that can generate nationally representative mortality data. In the absence of medical certification of causes of death, the WHO standard verbal autopsy questionnaires can be used to generate population-level cause-of-death statistics. ","The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the important use of mortality data. The analysis of excess mortality, which is the extra number of deaths compared to what would be expected in normal times, revealed the true impact of the pandemic. Excess mortality includes deaths resulting directly from COVID-19 and those indirectly related to it, for example when over-stretched healthcare systems struggle to provide care to patients during the pandemic. From January 2020 to December 2021, around 14.9 million extra deaths happened because of the pandemic. WHO response ",
Climate change,"Key facts Climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and hurricanes and they are increasing in scale, frequency and intensity. Overview ",,"Research shows that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone. The direct damage costs to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) is estimated to be between US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030. ","Temperature and precipitation changes enhance the spread of vector-borne diseases. Without preventive actions, deaths from such diseases, currently over 700 000 annually, may rise. Climate change induces both immediate mental health issues, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and long-term disorders due to factors like displacement and disrupted social cohesion. Recent research attributes 37% of heat-related deaths to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths among those over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98 million more experienced food insecurity compared to the 1981–2010 average. The WHO conservatively projects 250 000 additional yearly deaths by the 2030s due to climate change impacts on diseases like malaria and coastal flooding. However, modelling challenges persist, especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures. ","Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions. Figure: An overview of climate-sensitive health risks, their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly, and is strongly mediated by environmental, social and public health determinants. ","Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all.

Colorectal cancer,Overview ,"Common symptoms include diarrhoea, constipation, blood in the stool, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and low iron levels. Many people will not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. ",Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon (large intestine) or rectum. It is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. It can cause severe harm and death. The risk of colorectal cancer increases with age. Most cases affect people over 50 years old. ,Prevention Lifestyle changes and regular screening can help prevent colorectal cancer. ,"Incidence rates of colorectal cancer have been decreasing in high-income countries, largely as a result of effective screening programmes. The prognosis for colorectal cancer varies depending on the stage at diagnosis. Early-stage cancers have higher survival rates than advanced-stage cancers. Timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and regular follow-up care are important for improving survival rates and quality of life. Risk Factors ","The WHO is actively involved in addressing the global burden of colorectal cancer and implementing strategies to reduce its impact. WHO's approach involves raising awareness, cancer prevention and control, early detection and screening, strengthening health systems, capacity building, research and surveillance, as well as collaboration and partnerships. These comprehensive efforts contribute to reducing the burden of colorectal cancer by promoting prevention, early detection, equitable access to quality care, and improving overall cancer control globally. "
Commercial determinants of health,Overview ,,"The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, the systems put in place to deal with illness, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness, but also promotes healthy lives and societal equity. Commercial determinants of health are a key social determinant, and refer to the conditions, actions and omissions by commercial actors that affect health. Commercial determinants arise in the context of the provision of goods or services for payment and include commercial activities, as well as the environment in which commerce takes place. They can have beneficial or detrimental impacts on health. ","Harmful use of intellectual property law can prevent some communities to access affordable medicines. However, there are positive contributions by to public health, for example when companies implement the following health interventions: ",,"Unsafe or toxic work environments can impact employee mental health, for example for women working in the ready-made garment industry. Commercial action in knowledge environments can foment groundless doubt and contribute to climate change denialism or vaccine hesitancy. "
Community-based health insurance,Key Facts ,,"Both theory and evidence suggest that the traditional CBHI model – relying only on voluntary, small-scale schemes with little or no subsidization of poor and vulnerable groups – can play only a limited role in helping countries move towards universal health coverage(UHC). CBHIs cannot be expected to provide a major source of funding or coverage, and hence can at best provide only a complementary role as part of a national health financing strategy toward UHC. This is partly because people with few health needs tend not to join on a voluntary basis, and there is usually little or no subsidization for poor and other vulnerable groups. Health service utilization rates of members, however, generally increase after enrollment. ","Despite much hope in these systems, evidence suggests the impact of CBHI on financial protection and access to needed health care are moderate for those enrolled. Most CBHI schemes have low participation levels and the poorest people usually remain excluded. ","Community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes are usually voluntary and characterized by community members pooling funds to offset the cost of healthcare. Despite much hope in these systems, evidence suggests the impact of CBHI on financial protection and access to needed health care are moderate for those enrolled. ","They can have other positive impacts however, such as community development and local accountability of health care providers. Overview "
Condoms,Key facts Overview ,,"When using a condom, lubricants (also known as lube) make it less likely that the condom will break, slip or fall off and can enhance pleasure during sex. This is especially important during anal sex as the rectum, unlike the vagina, does not have natural lubrication. Use of a water- or silicone-based lube is recommended, as other types may cause the condom to break, such as kitchen oil, butter and hand lotion. Lube may also be helpful for individuals who experience vaginal dryness associated with menopause or other skin conditions in the genital area. Effectiveness ","In 2020, 374 million new STI infections occurred globally among adults aged 15–49 with 1 of the 4 curable STIs: syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis. Most of these of these could be prevented with the correct use of condoms. Condoms have had a significant impact on the global HIV epidemic: model simulations have estimated that increased condom use since 1990 has averted approximately 117 million new HIV infections (1). ","WHO’s work on controlling the spread of STIs, including HIV, is guided by the Global health sector strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections, 2022–2030. This includes the scale-up primary prevention such as condom availability and use. In addition, WHO supports countries’ efforts to create an encouraging environment allowing individuals to discuss STIs, adopt safer sexual practices, seek treatment and provide accessibility of people-centred quality STI care. WHO also includes condoms use as part of its contraception and family planning portfolios, ensuring that all people have access to their preferred contraceptive methods and the ability to determine if, when and how often to reproduce. This includes producing evidence-based guidelines on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods and their provision, developing quality standards for their manufacture, providing pre-qualification of approved contraceptive commodities and helping countries introduce these methods. ","Global impact Condoms are currently the only  available multi-purpose prevention technology against HIV, STIs and unplanned pregnancy. Condom use has been a significant tool to decrease transmission of HIV globally. A modelling study that examined the impact of past and future condom use on the AIDS epidemic in 77 high-burden countries noted that increased condom use since 1990 has averted an estimated 117 million new HIV infections, close to half (47%) of them in sub-Saharan Africa and more than one third (37%) in Asia and the Pacific (1). "
Congenital disorders,"Overview Congenital disorders are also known as congenital abnormalities, congenital malformations or birth defects. They can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (for example, metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth, or sometimes may only be detected later in infancy, such as hearing defects. Broadly, congenital refers to the existence at or before birth. ",,The proportion of under-5 deaths due to congenital disorders increases as other causes of under-5 deaths are controlled (fig. 1). Fig 1: Changes in causes of under 5 deaths as under 5 mortality rates decline ,Prevention Preventive public health measures work to decrease the frequency of certain congenital disorders through the removal of risk factors or the reinforcement of protective factors. Important interventions and efforts include: ,"Low-income may be an indirect determinant of congenital disorders, with a higher frequency among resource-constrained families and countries. It is estimated that about 94% of severe congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries. An indirect determinant, this higher risk relates to a possible lack of access to sufficient nutritious foods by pregnant women, an increased exposure to agents or factors such as infection and alcohol, or poorer access to health care and screening. Maternal age is also a risk factor for abnormal intrauterine fetal development. Advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. ",raising awareness on the importance of newborn screening programmes and their role in identifying infants born with congenital disorders; supporting families who have children with congenital disorders and associated disabilities; and 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19),Overview ,"COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die, but most people will recover without treatment. ","COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It usually spreads between people in close contact. COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death. Although a person can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, they are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. ",Prevention People should get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn. They should follow local guidance on vaccination and ways to protect themselves against COVID-19. ,"People with severe disease and those needing hospital treatment should receive treatment as soon as possible. The consequences of severe COVID-19 include death, respiratory failure, sepsis, thromboembolism (blood clots), and multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys. In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection. ",
Corporal punishment and health,Overview ,,"Corporal or physical punishment is defined by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which oversees the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as “any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light.” According to the Committee, this mostly involves hitting (smacking, slapping, spanking) children with a hand or implement (whip, stick, belt, shoe, wooden spoon or similar) but it can also involve, for example, kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion. ","UNICEF’s data from nationally representative surveys in 56 countries 2005–2013 show that approximately 6 out of 10 children aged 2–14 years experienced corporal punishment by adults in their households in the past month. On average, 17% of children experienced severe physical punishment (being hit on the head, face or ears or hit hard and repeatedly) but in some countries this figure exceeds 40%. Large variations across countries and regions show the potential for prevention. Apart from some countries where rates among boys are higher, results from comparable surveys show that the prevalence of corporal punishment is similar for girls and boys. Young children (aged 2–4 years) are as likely, and in some countries more likely, as older children (aged 5–14 years) to be exposed to physical punishment, including harsh forms. Physical disciplinary methods are used even with very young children – comparable surveys conducted in 29 countries 2012–2016 show that 3 in 10 children aged 12–23 months are subjected to spanking. ","Other non-physical forms of punishment can be cruel and degrading, and thus also incompatible with the Convention, and often accompany and overlap with physical punishment. These include punishments which belittle, humiliate, denigrate, scapegoat, threaten, scare or ridicule the child. Scope ","Consequences Corporal punishment triggers harmful psychological and physiological responses. Children not only experience pain, sadness, fear, anger, shame and guilt, but feeling threatened also leads to physiological stress and the activation of neural pathways that support dealing with danger. Children who have been physically punished tend to exhibit high hormonal reactivity to stress, overloaded biological systems, including the nervous, cardiovascular and nutritional systems, and changes in brain structure and function. "
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever,Overview ,"Signs and symptoms The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to three days, with a maximum of nine days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. ","Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10–40%. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north – the geographical limit of the principal tick vector. ",Prevention and control Controlling CCHF in animals and ticks ,"Treatment Early intensive supportive care including fluid management and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival chance.

Deafness and hearing loss,"Key facts By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people are projected to have some degree of hearing loss, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation. Unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of almost US$ 1 trillion. Overview ",,"Causes of hearing loss and deafness Although these factors can be encountered at different periods across the life span, individuals are most susceptible to their effects during critical periods in life. ",Prevention Many of the causes that lead to hearing loss can be avoided through public health strategies and clinical interventions implemented across the life course. ,"An annual additional investment of less than US$ 1.40 per person is needed to scale up ear and hearing care services globally. Over a 10-year period, this promises a return of nearly US$ 16 for every US dollar invested. ",cerumen impaction (impacted ear wax) trauma to the ear or head 
Deliberate events,Key facts Overview ,,"Deliberate events (DEs) are malicious acts with the intention to cause harm. The scope includes traditional chemical, biological and radio-nuclear agents and emerging threats such as cyber-attacks and dis-information campaigns. DEs may be announced or occur covertly with uncertainty or ambiguity as to the cause or whether the cause was deliberate. ","DEs involve both health and security dimensions. In conflict or war, key health infrastructure or CBRN facilities can be deliberately damaged, contaminated or destroyed with widespread consequences. Geopolitical shifts and conflicts create new circumstances for DEs. In addition to these traditional agents, emerging threats include disinformation and the misuse of cyber and technology means, with direct or indirect consequences on human health (fear, mistrust, major psychological impacts, delay in access to care, etc.). Scientific advances and access to technological and digital tools have increased the potential risks of high-consequence DEs. Atomic science is known as a typical example of a so-called double-edged sword; something that has or can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences. For example, nuclear power can be used for sustainable and large-scale energy production or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This is also true for health and life science research, which is sometimes known as dual-use research of concern (DURC). For example, while understanding key characteristics of microorganisms will help prevention and control of infectious diseases, application of gene editing and reconstruction science can lead to a new and disastrous pathogen. The public health, economic and national security consequences from DEs have made it necessary for governments to seek to prevent such use, to have the means of detecting such events and to prepare for and be ready to respond to them. These efforts should be developed as an integral part of existing national emergency and public health plans. Uncertainty about exposure to a deliberately released agent is likely to increase fear, anxiety and panic amongst the general public. Preparedness, training and education, risk communication and debriefing aimed at mitigating psychological consequences are important to consider for ensuring the mental health of front-line workers and affected populations. ",,"The scale of consequence of DEs could vary widely – from DEs aimed at individuals or small groups of people with minor or major impacts to DEs that cause mass casualties and cascading consequences of potentially public health emergencies of international concern. Addressing DEs involves both health and security dimensions. When a DE is suspected, response efforts will have to balance medical, public health, epidemiological and humanitarian response efforts with criminal and forensic investigations involving national and/or international authorities across multiple agencies, requiring coordination across a range of actors, resources and capacities. "
Dementia,"Key facts In 2021, 57 million people had dementia worldwide, over 60% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases. Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. ","Signs and symptoms Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities. ","Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies globally US$ 1.3 trillion, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day. ","Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent additional damage to the brain due to vascular dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with severe symptoms of depression in people living with dementia if lifestyle and social changes don’t work, but  these should not be the first option. ","Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly. Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also provide 70% of care hours for people living with dementia. Overview ","Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care. "
Dengue and severe dengue,Key facts Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. About half of the world's population is now at risk of dengue with an estimated 100–400 million infections occurring each year. Overview ,"Most people who get dengue will not have symptoms. But for those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and rash. Most will get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital. In severe cases, dengue can be fatal. ","While many dengue infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, the virus can occasionally cause more severe cases, and even death. Prevention and control of dengue depend on vector control. There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue. ","Community risks to dengue also depend on a population’s knowledge, attitude and practice towards dengue, as the exposure is closely related to behaviours such as water storage, plant keeping, and self-protection against mosquito bites.  Routine vector surveillance and control activities engaging community greatly enhances a community’s resilience. Vectors might adapt to new environments and climate. The interaction between dengue virus, the host and the environment is dynamic. Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, in combination with increased urbanization and movement of populations. ",Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently. Symptoms ,"Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic: the changing distribution of the vectors (chiefly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes), especially in previously dengue naïve countries; the consequences of El Niño phenomena in 2023 and climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall and humidity; fragile health systems in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically (2). Another study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses (3). "
Depressive disorder (depression),"Overview Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work. ","Symptoms and patterns During a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities. ","An estimated 3.8% of the population experience depression, including 5% of adults (4% among men and 6% among women), and 5.7% of adults older than 60 years. Approximately 280 million people in the world have depression (1). Depression is about 50% more common among women than among men. Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression (2). More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds. Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment (3). Barriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders. ","Contributing factors and prevention Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself. ",Diagnosis and treatment There are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression. ,"A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individual’s functioning. There are different patterns of depressive episodes including: "
Diabetes,Key facts The number of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million in 2022. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Overview ,"Symptoms Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed. ","Diabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. In 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths. In addition, around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucose. ","A healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications. ","More than half of people living with diabetes did not take medication for their diabetes in 2022. Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. ",
Diarrhoeal disease,Key facts Overview ,,Diarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children 1–59 months of age. It is both preventable and treatable. Each year diarrhoea kills around 443 832 children under 5 and an additional 50 851 children aged 5 to 9 years. ,"A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene. Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease every year. ","Interventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 10–14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes. There are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea: ",
Dioxins,"Key facts Dioxins are a group of chemically related compounds that are persistent environmental pollutants (POPs). Dioxins are found throughout the world in the environment and they accumulate in the food chain, mainly in the fatty tissue of animals. ",,"Dioxins are highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and cause cancer. All people have background exposure to dioxins, which is not expected to affect human health. However, due to the highly toxic potential, efforts are needed to reduce current background exposure. ","Prevention or reduction of human exposure is best done via source-directed measures, i.e. strict control of industrial processes to reduce formation of dioxins. Overview ",,"Many countries monitor their food supply for dioxins. This has led to early detection of contamination and has often prevented larger impacts. In many instances dioxin contamination is introduced via contaminated animal feed, e.g. incidences of increased dioxin levels in milk or animal feed were traced back to clay, fat or citrus pulp pellets used in the production of the animal feed. Although all countries can be affected, most contamination cases have been reported in industrialized countries where adequate food contamination monitoring, greater awareness of the hazard and better regulatory controls are available. "
Diphtheria,Key facts Overview ,"The diphtheria toxin causes damage to the respiratory tract and can spread throughout the body.  Common symptoms include fever, sore throat and swelling of the neck glands. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with diphtheria or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the infection. ","Diphtheria is a disease caused by a bacterium that affects the upper respiratory tract and less often the skin. It also produces a toxin that damages the heart and the nerves. Diphtheria is a vaccine preventable disease, but multiple doses and booster doses are needed to produce and sustain immunity. ","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted delivery of routine immunization services and surveillance activities.  These setbacks have left many children susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases such as diphtheria. No WHO region is completely free from diphtheria, and areas with low immunization coverage with the diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine allow the bacteria to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated and under vaccinated individuals at risk. ","For unvaccinated individuals, without proper treatment, diphtheria can be fatal in around 30% of cases, with young children at higher risk of dying (1). Recent diphtheria outbreaks stress the importance of sustaining high levels of vaccination coverage in communities across the life course. ",
Disability,Overview ,,"Disability is part of being human and is integral to the human experience. It results from the interaction between health conditions such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of environmental and personal factors. An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 16% of the global population – experience a significant disability today. This number is growing because of an increase in noncommunicable diseases and people living longer. Persons with disabilities are a diverse group, and factors such as sex, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, race, ethnicity and their economic situation affect their experiences in life and their health needs. Persons with disabilities die earlier, have poorer health, and experience more limitations in everyday functioning than others. Factors contributing to health inequities ",The World Health Assembly Resolution WHA74.8 on the highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities calls for Member States to ensure that persons with disabilities receive effective health services as part of universal health coverage; equal protection during emergencies; and equal access to cross-sectoral public health interventions. Achieving health for all ,"Structural factors: Persons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health. Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization. Social determinants of health: Poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and poor living conditions all add to the risk of poor health and unmet health care needs among persons with disabilities. Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls). ",
Dracunculiasis (Guinea-worm disease),"Key facts Dracunculiasis is a crippling parasitic disease on the verge of eradication, with 13 human cases reported in 2024 (provisional) and 14 in 2023. From the time infection occurs, it takes 10–14 months for the transmission cycle to complete, at which point a mature female worm emerges from the body. Overview ",,"Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease, is a parasitic disease transmitted through contaminated drinking water, causing a painful blister from which a worm slowly emerges. It results from ingesting the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. Although it rarely causes death, infected individuals are often incapacitated for weeks or months. This disease predominantly affects rural, underserved, and remote populations that rely on open, stagnant water sources (e.g., ponds) for drinking-water. Scope of the problem ","Elimination and then eradication of dracunculiasis have been championed by the World Health Assembly (WHA) via several key resolutions: WHA39.21 (1986), WHA42.29 (1989), WHA44.5 (1991), WHA57.9 (2004), and WHA64.16 (2011). In May 1981, the Interagency Steering Committee for Cooperative Action for the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981–1990) identified dracunculiasis elimination as a benchmark of success for the Decade. That same year, the WHA adopted resolution WHA34.25, recognizing the opportunity to interrupt transmission of dracunculiasis during the Decade. This led WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a systematic strategy and technical guidance. In 1986, The Carter Center joined the global campaign against the disease, in partnership with WHO and UNICEF. Later, the WHA, through resolution WHA64.16 (2011), urged all Member States where dracunculiasis was still endemic to expedite interrupting transmission and strengthen nationwide surveillance measures necessary for its eradication. ","Community education: Highlighting the importance of early case detection and reporting, alongside preventing animals from contaminating water, and proper management of aquatic animals’ waste. Case containment: Immediately isolating infected individuals or animals, providing wound care, and proactive tethering of domestic dogs and cats. ",
Drinking-water,Overview ,,"Diarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. In 2021, over 251.4 million people required preventative treatment for schistosomiasis – an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water. In many parts of the world, insects that live or breed in water carry and transmit diseases such as dengue fever. Some of these insects, known as vectors, breed in clean, rather than dirty water, and household drinking water containers can serve as breeding grounds. The simple intervention of covering water storage containers can reduce vector breeding and may also reduce faecal contamination of water at the household level. ","296 million people taking water from unprotected wells and springs; and 115 million people collecting untreated surface water from lakes, ponds, rivers and streams. ","Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction. In 2010, the UN General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. Everyone has the right to sufficient, continuous, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use. ","With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health, and therefore better school attendance, with positive longer-term consequences for their lives.

Drowning,Key facts There are around 300 000 annual drowning deaths worldwide. ,,Drowning is the fourth leading cause of death for children aged 1–4 years and the third leading cause of death for children aged 5–14 years. Ninety-two percent of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. ,Resolutions endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly and the World Health Assembly provide a roadmap for global drowning prevention efforts. Overview ,"Community-based, supervised childcare for pre-school children can reduce drowning risk and has other proven health benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But these efforts must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety. Preventing drowning: Practical guidance for the provision of day-care, basic swimming and water safety skills, and safe rescue and resuscitation training (2022) ",Drowning disproportionately impacts children and young people. Children aged under 5 years account for nearly a quarter of all drowning deaths. Drowning is the fourth leading cause of death for children aged 1–4 years and the third leading cause of death for children aged 5–14 years. 
E. coli,Overview ,"Symptoms Symptoms of the diseases caused by STEC include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that may in some cases progress to bloody diarrhoea (haemorrhagic colitis). Fever and vomiting may also occur. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days, with a median of 3 to 4 days. Most patients recover within 10 days, but in a small proportion of patients (particularly young children and the elderly), the infection may lead to a life-threatening disease, such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets). ","Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. Most strains of E. coli are harmless. Some strains however, such as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), can cause severe foodborne disease. It is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk, and contaminated raw vegetables and sprouts. STEC produces toxins, known as Shiga-toxins because of their similarity to the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae. STEC can grow in temperatures ranging from 7 °C to 50 °C, with an optimum temperature of 37 °C. Some STEC can grow in acidic foods, down to a pH of 4.4, and in foods with a minimum water activity (aW) of 0.95. ","Prevention The prevention of infection requires control measures at all stages of the food chain, from agricultural production on the farm to processing, manufacturing and preparation of foods in both commercial establishments and household kitchens. ",Persons who experience bloody diarrhoea or severe abdominal cramps should seek medical care. Antibiotics are not part of the treatment of patients with STEC disease and may possibly increase the risk of subsequent HUS. Sources and transmission ,
Ebola disease,"Key facts Ebola disease is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. ",Early intensive supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival. Approved vaccines and treatments are only available for one of the viruses (Ebola virus) and are under development for the others. ,"Three different viruses are known to cause large Ebola disease outbreaks: Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus. The average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks. ","Outbreak control relies on a package of interventions including intensive supportive care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, vaccination if relevant, and social mobilization. Overview ","While there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development. Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival. Seeking early care can be lifesaving. ","The impact on the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression. Diagnosis "
Echinococcosis,"alveolar echinococcosis, caused by infection with E. multilocularis; ",Signs and symptoms Cystic echinococcosis / hydatid disease ,"Human echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by parasites, namely tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Echinococcosis occurs in 4 forms: cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease or hydatidosis, caused by infection with a species complex centred on Echinococcus granulosus; ","Surveillance, prevention and control Robust surveillance data is fundamental in order to show burden of disease and to evaluate progress and success of control programmes. However, as for other neglected diseases which are focused in underserved populations and remote areas, data is especially scarce and will need more attention if control programmes are to be implemented and measured. ","The asymptomatic incubation period of the disease can last many years until hydatid cysts grow to an extent that triggers clinical signs, however approximately half of all patients that receive medical treatment for infection do so within a few years of their initial infection with the parasite. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are commonly seen when hydatids occur in the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Other signs depend on the location of the hydatid cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. Non-specific signs include anorexia, weight loss and weakness. ","Mongolia has recognized the importance of echinococcosis as a public-health problem and, at the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO in 2013 conducted an initial situation analysis. The analysis focused on implementing early diagnosis and building a basic surveillance system covering humans and animals to understand the actual burden of the disease. A cross-sectional study conducted in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey in 2014-2015, found that the true burden of CE is poorly understood and that many cases remain asymptomatic, with no appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. The study assessed the prevalence of the disease among rural populations in the three countries. "
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO),"Key facts El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important sources of annual global climate variability, second only to the earth–sun relationship that drives the seasons. El Niño and its counterpart La Niña are associated with characteristic patterns of rainfall and temperature, which can include extreme events such as flooding and drought. Overview ",,"Any transition from a La Niña to an El Niño phase will likely produce a rise in global average surface temperature, with warming tendencies affecting the development of extreme heat in the Southern Hemisphere. The joint influence of both El Niño warming and rising global temperatures caused by climate change amplifies the potential for extreme heat in many regions, creating deadly conditions for millions of people. Learn more about heat and climate change ","Observed associations between ENSO and health impacts are not linear or unequivocal but depend on the ENSO intensity, time of the year and other factors. Impacts tend to be more intense in less developed countries where populations have limited coping capacity and are often more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather and climate. Their livelihoods are often highly dependent on natural resources and rain-fed agricultural practices; housing typically lacks protection against extreme weather events; access to health care and safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation facilities may be limited; and infectious diseases determined by environmental conditions are often pre-existing. Vector-borne diseases ",,"ENSO affects many parts of the globe, but most intensely impacts the tropics, including countries and areas in Africa, Latin America and South and South-East Asia that are particularly vulnerable to natural hazards. By altering climate conditions, ENSO can have severe effects on key health determinants through, among other factors, impacts on food security, air and water quality, ecosystems and health infrastructure safety. ENSO is also associated with altered transmission patterns of vector-borne, rodent-borne and waterborne diseases, as well as fish and shellfish poisoning. "
Electricity in health-care facilities,Overview ,,,,"Electricity is needed to power the most basic services in health-care facilities, from lighting and communications to clean water supply. Reliable power is also crucial for the medical equipment necessary to safely manage childbirth or to ensure immunization as well as for undertaking most of the routine and emergency procedures. Reliable energy provision – particularly electricity – is a major enabler of universal health coverage. A number of clean and cost-effective energy solutions, such as based on solar photovoltaic systems, are available and rapidly deployable to electrify health-care facilities sustainably and increase their climate resiliency. Yet, as highlighted in the report Energizing health: accelerating electricity access in health-care facilities, close to 1 billion people in low- and lower-middle-income countries are estimated to be served by health-care facilities without reliable electricity access or with no electricity access at all. In low- and lower-middle-income countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 12% and 15% of health-care facilities, respectively, have no access to electricity whatsoever. There is a sharp urban–rural divide: urban health-care facilities often report more access to electricity and more reliable electricity than rural facilities in the same country. ","WHO supports countries ensure a reliable supply of electricity for health-care facilities by providing the knowledge and tools to a) understand the energy access situation and the energy needs of health-care facilities in their country, b) build the institutional capacity to identify the most suitable energy solutions to meet their needs, c) build an enabling framework to accelerate health-care facility electrification, and d) support high-level advocacy, coordination and mobilization of adequate resources for impact on the ground.

Electronic waste (e-waste),"Key facts E-waste is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world (1). In 2022, an estimated 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced globally. Only 22.3% was documented as formally collected and recycled (2). Overview ",,"Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing solid waste streams in the world (1). Less than a quarter of e-waste produced globally in 2022 was known to be formally recycled; however, e-waste streams contain valuable and finite resources that can be reused if they are recycled appropriately. E-waste has therefore become an important income stream for individuals and some communities. People living in low- and middle-income (LMICs), particularly children, face the most significant risks from e-waste due to lack of appropriate regulations and enforcement, recycling infrastructure and training. Despite international regulations targeting the control of the transport of e-waste from one country to another, its transboundary movement to LMICs continues, frequently illegally. E-waste is considered hazardous waste as it contains toxic materials and can produce toxic chemicals when recycled inappropriately. Many of these toxic materials are known or suspected to cause harm to human health, and several are included in the 10 chemicals of public health concern, including dioxins, lead and mercury. Inferior recycling of e-waste is a threat to public health and safety. Exposure to e-waste ",Prevention and management National and international actions are essential to protect communities from unsound e-waste recycling activities. Actions that can be taken include: ,developing and implementing national e-waste management legislation that protects public health; incorporating health protection measures into national legislation; ,"Children and pregnant women are at high risk to hazardous substances released through informal e-waste recycling activities due to their unique vulnerabilities. Children have different exposures to e-waste recycling activities than adults. E-waste recycling activities release toxic chemicals that can cross the placenta and may contaminate breastmilk, for example mercury. Fetuses and young children are highly sensitive to many pollutants released through e-waste recycling due to their rapidly developing bodies, including their respiratory, immune and central nervous systems. E-waste contains several known neurotoxicants, including lead and mercury, that may disrupt the development of the central nervous system during pregnancy, infancy, childhood and adolescence. Some harmful toxicants from e-waste may also impact the structural development and function of the lungs. Changes to children’s developing systems may cause irreparable harm and affect them for the rest of their lives. Prevention and management "
Emergency contraception,What is emergency contraception? ,,"If vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking a dose, the dose should be repeated. ECPs with LNG or with UPA are preferable to COCs because they cause less nausea and vomiting. Routine use of anti-emetics before taking ECPs is not recommended. Drugs used for emergency contraception do not harm future fertility. There is no delay in the return to fertility after taking ECPs. ",Emergency contraception refers to methods of contraception that can be used to prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse. These are recommended for use within 5 days but are more effective the sooner they are used after the act of intercourse. Mode of action ,"The WHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use states that IUD insertion may further increase the risk of PID among women at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although limited evidence suggests that this risk if low. Current algorithms for determining increased risk of STIs have poor predictive value. Risk of STIs varies by individual behaviour and local STI prevalence. Therefore, while many women at increased risk of STIs can generally have an IUD inserted, some women at a very high likelihood of STIs should generally not have an IUD inserted until appropriate testing and treatment occur. Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use ",
Endometriosis,Overview ,"The cause of endometriosis is unknown. There is no known way to prevent endometriosis. There is no cure, but its symptoms can be treated with medicines or, in some cases, surgery. It causes a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in the formation of scar tissue (adhesions, fibrosis) within the pelvis and other parts of the body. Several lesion types have been described: ",Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant. Endometriosis can start at a person’s first menstrual period and last until menopause. ,"Endometriosis has significant social, public health and economic implications. It can decrease quality of life due to severe pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and infertility. Some individuals with endometriosis experience debilitating pain that prevents them from going to work or school. Painful sex due to endometriosis can lead to interruption or avoidance of intercourse and affect the sexual health of affected individuals and their partners. Addressing endometriosis will empower those affected by it by supporting their human right to the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health, quality of life and overall well-being. Prevention ","Endometriosis symptoms are variable and broad, meaning that healthcare workers may not easily diagnose it. Individuals with symptoms may not be aware of the condition. Causes ","Impact Endometriosis has significant social, public health and economic implications. It can decrease quality of life due to severe pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and infertility. Some individuals with endometriosis experience debilitating pain that prevents them from going to work or school. Painful sex due to endometriosis can lead to interruption or avoidance of intercourse and affect the sexual health of affected individuals and their partners. Addressing endometriosis will empower those affected by it by supporting their human right to the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health, quality of life and overall well-being. "
Epilepsy,"Overview Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disease of the brain that affects around 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized) and are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and control of bowel or bladder function. Seizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. Seizures can also vary in frequency, from less than one per year to several per day. ","Signs and symptoms Characteristics of seizures vary and depend on where in the brain the disturbance first starts, and how far it spreads. Temporary symptoms occur, such as loss of awareness or consciousness, and disturbances of movement, sensation (including vision, hearing and taste), mood, or other cognitive functions. ","A great proportion of the causes of death related to epilepsy, especially in low- and middle-income countries, are potentially preventable, such as falls, drowning, burns and prolonged seizures. Rates of disease ","Globally, an estimated 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In high-income countries, there are estimated to be 49 per 100 000 people diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In low- and middle-income countries, this figure can be as high as 139 per 100 000. This is likely due to the increased risk of endemic conditions such as malaria or neurocysticercosis; the higher incidence of road traffic injuries; birth-related injuries; and variations in medical infrastructure, the availability of preventive health programmes and accessible care. Close to 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries. Causes ","Epilepsy accounts for a significant proportion of the world’s disease burden, affecting around 50 million people worldwide. The estimated proportion of the general population with active epilepsy (i.e. continuing seizures or with the need for treatment) at a given time is between 4 and 10 per 1000 people. Globally, an estimated 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In high-income countries, there are estimated to be 49 per 100 000 people diagnosed with epilepsy each year. In low- and middle-income countries, this figure can be as high as 139 per 100 000. This is likely due to the increased risk of endemic conditions such as malaria or neurocysticercosis; the higher incidence of road traffic injuries; birth-related injuries; and variations in medical infrastructure, the availability of preventive health programmes and accessible care. Close to 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries. ","One seizure does not signify epilepsy (up to 10% of people worldwide have one seizure during their lifetime). Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one of the world’s oldest recognized conditions, with written records dating back to 4000 BCE. Fear, misunderstanding, discrimination and social stigma have surrounded epilepsy for centuries. This stigma continues in many countries today and can impact on the quality of life for people with the disease and their families. Signs and symptoms "
Essential medicines,Key facts Overview ,,,"While the cost of a medicine is a consideration in the selection process, a high absolute cost of a medicine does not necessarily prevent it from being added to the WHO Model List if it otherwise meets the required selection criteria. Since 2002, affordability has evolved from being a precondition of listing a medicine on the Model list to being a consequence. Listing a medicine on the Model List is one step in a series of actions that can lead to lower costs, better affordability and greater access. The number of patented medicines on the Model List has increased over time from 17/319 (5%) in 2003 to 82/502 (16%) in 2023. ","Essential medicines treat the priority healthcare needs of the population. Essential medicines should be available, affordable and of assured quality at all times. ","Impact and implementation Over 150 countries have adopted national lists of essential medicines based on the WHO Model List. Essential medicines lists serve as a basis for procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector, reimbursement and insurance schemes, medicine donations and local medicine production (1). When properly implemented, the essential medicines concept can help improve health outcomes and achieve progress towards universal health coverage. The essential medicines concept has been successfully implemented in various countries and regions. Studies have shown that essential medicines lists are associated with greater availability of essential medicines than non-essential medicines (2), increased access (3), better prescribing and quality of care, and cost savings (4). "
Falls,,,"Globally, falls are a major public health problem. An estimated 684 000 fatal falls occur each year, making it the second leading cause of unintentional injury death, after road traffic injuries. Over 80% of fall-related fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, with regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia accounting for 60% of these deaths. In all regions of the world, death rates are highest among adults over the age of 60 years. Though not fatal, approximately 37.3 million falls severe enough to require medical attention occur each year. Globally, falls are responsible for over 38 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost each year(2), and result in more years lived with disability than transport injury, drowning, burns and poisoning combined. ","The financial costs from fall-related injuries are substantial. For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in the Republic of Finland and Australia are US$ 3611 and US$ 1049 respectively. Evidence from Canada suggests the implementation of effective prevention strategies with a subsequent 20% reduction in the incidence of falls among children under 10 years of age could create a net savings of over US$ 120 million each year. Who is at risk? ","A fall is defined as an event which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor or other lower level. Fall-related injuries may be fatal or non-fatal(1) though most are non-fatal. For example, of children in the People's Republic of China, for every death due to a fall, there are 4 cases of permanent disability, 13 cases requiring hospitalization for more than 10 days, 24 cases requiring hospitalization for 1–9 days and 690 cases seeking medical care or missing work/school. The problem ","While nearly 40% of the total DALYs lost due to falls worldwide occurs in children, this measurement may not accurately reflect the impact of fall-related disabilities for older individuals who have fewer life years to lose. In addition, those individuals who fall and suffer a disability, particularly older people, are at a major risk for subsequent long-term care and institutionalization. The financial costs from fall-related injuries are substantial. For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in the Republic of Finland and Australia are US$ 3611 and US$ 1049 respectively. Evidence from Canada suggests the implementation of effective prevention strategies with a subsequent 20% reduction in the incidence of falls among children under 10 years of age could create a net savings of over US$ 120 million each year. "
Family planning/contraception methods,"Key facts Among the 1.9 billion women of reproductive age group (15–49 years) worldwide in 2021, 1.1 billion have a need for family planning; of these, 874 million are using modern contraceptive methods, and 164 million have an unmet need for contraception (1). The proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 3.7.1, has stagnated globally at around 77% from 2015 to 2022 but increased from 52% to 58% in sub-Saharan Africa (2). Overview ",,,"Only one contraceptive method, condoms, can prevent both a pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Use of contraception advances the human right of people to determine the number and spacing of their children. ",,"Impact Use of contraception prevents pregnancy-related health risks for women, especially for adolescent girls, and when expressed in terms of interbirth intervals, children born within 2 years of an elder sibling have a 60% increased risk of infant death, and those born within 2–3 years a 10% increased risk, compared with those born after an interval of 3 years or longer (4). It offers a range of potential non-health benefits that encompass expanded education opportunities and empowerment for women, and sustainable population growth and economic development for countries. "
Female genital mutilation,"Key facts More than 230 million girls and women alive today have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is practiced. FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15. ",,,"WHO supports a holistic health sector response to FGM prevention and care, by developing guidance and resources for health workers to prevent FGM and manage its complications and by supporting countries to adapt and implement these resources to local contexts. WHO also generates evidence to improve the understanding of FGM and what works to end this harmful practice. Since then, WHO has developed a global strategy against FGM medicalization with partner organizations and continues to support countries in its implementation. ","Treatment of the health complications of FGM is estimated to cost health systems US$ 1.4 billion per year, a number expected to rise unless urgent action is taken towards its abandonment. Overview ",
Food additives,"Key facts Food additives are substances primarily added to processed foods, or other foods produced on an industrial scale, for technical purposes, e.g. to improve safety, increase the amount of time a food can be stored, or modify sensory properties of food. Food additives are substances not normally consumed as a food by themselves and not normally used as typical ingredients in foods. Most minimally processed and unprocessed foods do not contain food additives. Overview ",,"Preservatives can slow decomposition caused by mould, air, bacteria or yeast. In addition to maintaining the quality of the food, preservatives help control contamination that can cause foodborne illness, including life-threatening botulism. Colouring is added to food to replace colours lost during processing or other production, or to make food appear more attractive. ","The safety assessments completed by JECFA are used by the joint intergovernmental food standard-setting body of FAO and WHO, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish levels for maximum use of additives in food and drinks. Codex standards are the reference for national standards for consumer protection, and for the international trade in food, so that consumers everywhere can be confident that the food they eat meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it was produced. Once a food additive has been found to be safe for use by JECFA and maximum use levels have been established in the Codex General Standard for Food Additives, national food regulations need to be implemented permitting the actual use of a food additive. ","The Codex Alimentarius Commission also establishes standards and guidelines on food labelling. These standards are implemented in most countries, and food manufacturers are obliged to indicate which additives are in their products. In the European Union, for example, there is legislation governing labelling of food additives according to a set of pre-defined E-numbers. People who have allergies or sensitivities to certain food additives should check labels carefully. WHO encourages national authorities to monitor and ensure that food additives in food and drinks produced in their countries comply with permitted uses, conditions and legislation. National authorities should oversee the food business, which carries the primary responsibility for ensuring that the use of a food additive is safe and complies with legislation. ",
Food safety,"Key facts Food safety, nutrition and food security are inextricably linked. An estimated 600 million – almost 1 in 10 people in the world – fall ill after eating contaminated food and 420 000 die every year. Overview ","Salmonella, Campylobacter and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli are some of the most common foodborne pathogens that affect millions of people annually, sometimes with severe and fatal outcomes. Symptoms can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Foods more frequently involved in outbreaks of salmonellosis include eggs, poultry and other products of animal origin. Foodborne cases due to Campylobacter are mainly caused by raw milk, raw or undercooked poultry and drinking water. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli is often associated with unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat and contaminated fresh fruits and vegetables. Listeria infections can lead to miscarriage in pregnant women or death of newborn babies. Although disease occurrence is relatively low, Listeria’s severe and sometimes fatal health consequences, particularly among infants, children and the elderly, count them among the most serious foodborne infections. Listeria is found in unpasteurised dairy products and various ready-to-eat foods and can grow at refrigeration temperatures. ","Access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health. Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances causes more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. It also creates a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young children, elderly and the sick. Good collaboration between governments, food producers and consumers is needed to help ensure food safety and stronger food systems. Major foodborne illnesses and causes ","WHO aims to strengthen national food control systems to facilitate global prevention, detection and response to public health threats associated with unsafe food. To do this, WHO supports Member States by: facilitating the implementation of the WHO Global Strategy for Food Safety (2022–2030) to support Member States to strengthen their national food control systems and reduce the burden of foodborne diseases through the activities of the WHO Alliance for Food Safety tacking the One Health approach; ","Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic development by straining health care systems and harming national economies, tourism, and trade. Food safety is a shared responsibility among different national authorities and requires a multisectoral, one health approach. ","Climate change is expected to have considerable impacts on food safety and will likely increase the risks from existing and emerging foodborne diseases through increases in extreme weather events, increases in air and water temperatures, and changes in precipitation frequency and intensity. These challenges put greater responsibility on food producers and handlers to ensure food safety. Local incidents can quickly evolve into international emergencies due to the speed and range of product distribution. "
Foodborne trematode infections,"Transmission and burden Foodborne trematodes are zoonotic and become infective only after completing a complex life cycle that involves stages in intermediate, non-human hosts. In all species, the first intermediate host is a freshwater snail. The second host differs according to species: for Clonorchis and Opisthorchis it is a freshwater fish and for Paragonimus it is a crustacean. Infection with Paragonimus spp can also result from the consumption of animals that feed on crustaceans e.g. raw wild boar meat. Fasciola spp. do not require a second intermediate host and can infect humans via the consumption of contaminated freshwater plants. The final host is always a mammal (Table 1). ",Symptoms The public health burden due to foodborne trematodiases is predominantly due to morbidity rather than mortality with early and light infections often going unnoticed. Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the organ in which the adult worms are located in. ,"The true burden associated with these infections is unclear as public health awareness and availability of health facilities is often limited in affected populations. Estimates from the WHO Foodborne disease burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) (2015) identified the 4 species of food borne trematodes as important causes of disability with an estimated annual total of 200 000 illnesses and more than 7 000 deaths per year, resulting in more than 2 million disability-adjusted life years globally. The added economic impact of foodborne trematodiases is significant and is linked to losses in the livestock and aquaculture industries due to reduced animal productivity, as well as to restrictions on exports and reduced consumer demand. ","Treatment, prevention and control Control of foodborne trematodiases aims to reduce the risk of infection and control associated morbidity. An integrated One Health approach which links animal, human and environmental aspects should be used.  Interventions such as information, education and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should be implemented to decrease transmission rates and reduce risk of infection. ","Clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis are confined largely to Asia, with many countries being endemic for these diseases. Some hyperendemic villages in Lao People’s Democratic Republic have had O. viverrini prevalences of more than 80% recorded. Paragonimiasis can be found in Africa, Asia and Latin America and can be co-endemic with tuberculosis, often resulting in inaccurate diagnosis and treatment, and contributing to underreporting of the disease. Fascioliasis is a global disease, affecting a significant number of countries throughout the world, with high burdens reported in Latin America and the Middle East. Although cases of foodborne trematodes have been reported from more than 70 countries worldwide, data on actual prevalence and burden is scarce, with a significant gap in epidemiological data from African countries. Within countries, transmission is often restricted to focal areas and reflects behavioural and ecological patterns. Inadequate sanitation and food hygiene, limited access to safe drinking water, and cultural food preferences are all associated with an increased risk of infection. Cultural food sharing habits may also contribute to familial and community clusters of infection. ",
Fragility fractures,"Key facts In 2019, there were 178 million new fractures globally, an increase of 33.4% of the absolute number of new fractures since 1990, partly driven by population growth and ageing. ","The same year, there were 455 million prevalent cases of acute or long-term symptoms of a fracture, an increase of 70.1% of the absolute prevalence since 1990. Globally in 2019, fractures accounted for 25.8 million years lived with disability (YLDs), an increase of 65.3% of the absolute YLDs since 1990. ","Fragility fractures result from low-energy trauma (a mechanical force that would not ordinarily cause a fracture), such as a fall from standing height or less. These fractures are the main clinical consequence of osteoporosis, although they may occur in postmenopausal women even in the absence of osteoporosis. The most common sites of fragility fractures are the: ","Owing to the global population growth and ageing, the annual incidence of total fractures worldwide is expected to continue to increase, driven by fragility fractures. However, an individual’s risk of fragility fracture can be predicted, and these fractures are preventable using effective interventions. Overview ","Bone fractures are partial or complete breaks in a bone, which may spontaneously occur (due to diseases such as osteoporosis and associated chronic conditions) or result from a fall or a trauma (due to road traffic accidents, sports, etc.). Fractures are a global public health concern and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Due to worldwide population growth and ageing, the number of people sustaining a fracture each year has been increasing. Currently, there are no global estimates on fragility fractures, and available data include all fractures combined. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, the absolute incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability for fractures have significantly increased from 1990 to 2019, with highest age-specific incidence rates in the oldest age groups (1) in which most fractures are due to bone fragility (fragility fractures). These substantial increases have been associated with increased healthcare costs globally. ",
Free health care policies,Overview ,,"Overall, the impacts of FHC policies have so far been mixed, especially for poor people, who may not benefit at all, or benefit to a lesser extent compared with better-off people. There are differences across and within countries, but overall, public funding tends to benefit better-off populations. Various aspects on the supply and demand sides may cause this trend in public funding. On the supply side, availability of health services is better in wealthier areas. On the demand-side, barriers can be financial and non-financial, such as limited geographical access to facilities or cultural and language barriers. Finally, setting up separate funding and remuneration mechanisms for FHC policies (when not linked with other health financing mechanisms) may contribute to fragmenting the health financing system. When there are several FHC policies in place for a variety of services, they may create disincentives to enrol in health insurance schemes with more comprehensive benefit packages. ","Evidence about the impact of FHC policies in terms of financial protection and health service utilization is mixed. If well-designed and implemented, FHC policies can expand coverage in countries with few resources and can therefore be part of a strategy and a catalyst to move towards universal health coverage (UHC). What is a free health care policy? ","Free health care policies – or politiques de gratuité – are about removing formal user fees. The removal of fees may apply to all health services, to the primary care level, to selected population groups, to selected services for everyone, or to selected services for specific population groups characterized by medical or economic vulnerability. Evidence about the impact of FHC policies in terms of financial protection and health service utilization is mixed. If well-designed and implemented, FHC policies can expand coverage in countries with few resources and can therefore be part of a strategy and a catalyst to move towards universal health coverage (UHC). ","Impact When introducing a FHC policy, a government explicitly intends to make progress towards UHC in two ways: "
Gambling,"Key facts Standardized global estimation of gambling harms has been limited, but estimates suggest that 1.2% of the world’s adult population has a gambling disorder. Harm from gambling by others is also widespread. Industry analysts estimate global gambling revenue will reach US$ 700 billion by 2028 (1). Smartphone use in low- and middle-income countries will drive much of this growth. Overview ","Signs and symptoms Gambling disorder is described alongside substance use disorders in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM 5), and the International Classification of Diseases, eleventh revision (ICD 11). The ICD-11 describes three diagnostic requirements: ",,"Gambling can lead to serious harms to health. These include financial stress, relationship breakdown, family violence, mental illness and suicide. The legacy of gambling harm can endure throughout one’s life and transmit intergenerationally. Population-wide interventions can help prevent and reduce harm. These include ending advertising and promotions, providing centralized account registration to require those who gamble to set binding loss limits, and restrictions relating to access and availability (opening hours, density). Strict regulation and enforcement are also required to ensure compliance with existing laws. Scope of the problem ","Gambling harm also occurs well below clinical thresholds. Signs of harm include the diversion of money from essential household spending. This can lead to food insecurity, housing problems and difficulties accessing healthcare and education.

Gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection),Key facts Overview ,"Most women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms, and when they do, vaginal discharge is common, while most men present with discharge from their penis. If left untreated, gonorrhoea can lead to infertility in both men and women and other sexual and reproductive health complications. It also increases the risk of HIV infection. ","Gonorrhoea is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is primarily transmitted through vaginal, oral or anal sex. In 2020 there were an estimated 82.4 million new infections among adults globally. ","Most cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with regular and correct condom use. Gonorrhoea causes different symptoms in women and men. Women often feel no symptoms, but untreated infection can lead to infertility and problems during pregnancy. ","Gonorrhoea is treatable and can be cured with some antibiotics. However, the emergence of N. gonorrhoeae resistant to antibiotics are making treatment of gonorrhoea more and more challenging, with the risk of becoming untreatable. Rational use of antibiotics and the development of new ones are critical to decrease this eminent threat. Signs and symptoms ",
Guillain–Barré syndrome,"Overview In Guillain-Barré syndrome, the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement as well as those that transmit pain, temperature and touch sensations. This can result in muscle weakness, loss of sensation in the legs and/or arms, and problems swallowing or breathing. It is a rare condition, and while it is more common in adults and in males, people of all ages can be affected. ","Symptoms Symptoms typically last a few weeks, with most individuals recovering without long-term, severe neurological complications. ","Causes Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is rare. The cause of it is not fully understood, but most cases follow an infection with a virus or bacteria. This leads the immune system to attack the body itself. Infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, which causes gastroenteritis (including symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other viral infections including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus. ","In rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of people getting GBS, but the chance of this occurring is extremely low. Studies show that people are much more likely to get GBS from infections such as the flu than from the vaccine given to prevent the infection, in this case the flu vaccine. Occasionally, surgery can trigger GBS. Diagnosis ","The ability to speak and swallow may become affected in severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These cases are considered life-threatening, and affected individuals should be treated in intensive-care units. Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, although some continue to experience weakness. ",
Health literacy,"Key facts Health literacy represents the personal knowledge and competencies that accumulate through daily activities, social interactions and across generations. Health literacy is mediated by the organizational structures and availability of resources that enable people to access, understand, appraise and use information and services in ways that promote and maintain good health and well-being for themselves and those around them – often described as organizational health literacy. Overview ",,,,"Meeting the health literacy needs of the most disadvantaged and marginalized societies can accelerate progress in reducing inequities in health and beyond. Efforts to raise health literacy will be crucial in achieving 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is critical to transforming health systems to provide quality, people-centred, and equitable care. Health literacy and existing inequalities ","Health literacy is associated with age, gender, educational attainment, income and occupation, poverty, racial/ethnic minority status, literacy and language skills, health insurance coverage, and self-reported health. Differences exist within and across population groups and settings. These differences, fuelled by disparities, can impact whether people can easily develop and use health literacy, and whether they have access to quality and trustworthy information and services. It is important to consider these disparities when developing health policies and allocating resources. Even people who read well and are comfortable using numbers can face health literacy issues when: they aren’t familiar with medical terms or how their bodies work; "
Health-care waste,Key facts Overview ,,,"Health-care activities protect and restore health and save lives. But what about the waste and by-products they generate? Of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, non-hazardous waste comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, chemical or radioactive.

","Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains. The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs.

These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and improving existing ones to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (such as regional nutrient profile models) that countries can use to implement the marketing recommendations. In 2012, the Health Assembly adopted a “Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition” and six global nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025, including the reduction of stunting, wasting and overweight in children, the improvement of breastfeeding, and the reduction of anaemia and low birthweight (9).

Heat and health,Key facts ,,"Heat is an important environmental and occupational health hazard. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and can exacerbate underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, asthma, and can increase the risk of accidents and transmission of some infectious diseases. Heatstroke is a medical emergency with a high-case fatality rate. The number of people exposed to extreme heat is growing exponentially due to climate change in all world regions. Heat-related mortality for people over 65 years of age increased by approximately 85% between 2000–2004 and 2017–2021 (1). ",The negative health impacts of heat are predictable and largely preventable with specific public health and multi-sectoral policies and interventions. WHO has issued guidance for public health institutions to identify and manage extreme heat risks. Action on climate change combined with comprehensive preparedness and risk management can save lives now and in the future. Overview ,,"A heatwave is a period where local excess heat accumulates over a sequence of unusually hot days and nights. Heatwaves and prolonged excess heat conditions are increasing in frequency, duration, intensity and magnitude due to climate change. Even low and moderate intensity heat waves can impact the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. The frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heat waves will continue to rise in the 21st century because of climate change. Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperature conditions create cumulative stress on the human body, increasing the risk of illness and death from heat exposure. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality and cascading socioeconomic impacts (for example, lost work capacity and labour productivity). They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, when power shortages accompany heatwaves and disrupt health facilities, transport and water infrastructure. "
Hepatitis A,Overview ,"Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease but it can cause mild to severe symptoms and rarely fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is often fatal. WHO estimates that in 2016, 7134 persons died from hepatitis A worldwide (accounting for 0.5% of the mortality due to viral hepatitis). Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Epidemics related to contaminated food or water can erupt explosively, such as the epidemic in Shanghai in 1988 that affected about 300 000 people (1). They can also be prolonged, affecting communities for months through person-to-person transmission. Hepatitis A viruses persist in the environment and can withstand food production processes routinely used to inactivate or control bacterial pathogens. ","Hepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with unsafe water or food, inadequate sanitation, poor personal hygiene and oral-anal sex. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease but it can cause mild to severe symptoms and rarely fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is often fatal. WHO estimates that in 2016, 7134 persons died from hepatitis A worldwide (accounting for 0.5% of the mortality due to viral hepatitis). ","Prevention Improved sanitation, food safety, safer sex practices (notably for oral-anal sex) and immunization are the most effective ways to combat hepatitis A. ","Treatment There is no specific antiviral treatment for hepatitis A. Instead, the management of hepatitis A focuses on supportive care to relieve symptoms and ensure adequate hydration and nutrition. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and can take several weeks or months. It is important to avoid unnecessary medications that can adversely affect the liver, e.g. acetaminophen, paracetamol. ",
Hepatitis B,Key facts ,Symptoms Most people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected. ,"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth and delivery, in early childhood, as well as through contact with blood or other body fluids during sex with an infected partner, unsafe injections or exposures to sharp instruments. ","Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available and effective. Overview ","Hepatitis B is also spread by needlestick injury, tattooing, piercing and exposure to infected blood and body fluids, such as saliva and menstrual, vaginal and seminal fluids. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes or sharp objects either in health care settings, in the community or among persons who inject drugs. Sexual transmission is more prevalent in unvaccinated persons with multiple sexual partners. Hepatitis B infection acquired in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of cases, whereas infection in infancy and early childhood leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases. This is the basis for strengthening and prioritizing infant and childhood vaccination. ","WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2023, WHO focused on the theme “One life, one liver” to illustrate the importance of the liver for a healthy life and the need to scale up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target. "
Hepatitis C,Key facts Overview ,"Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated with antiviral medications. ","Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, ranging in severity from a mild illness to a serious, lifelong illness including liver cirrhosis and cancer. ",Early detection and treatment can prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health. Acute HCV infections are usually asymptomatic and most do not lead to a life-threatening disease. Around 30% (15–45%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without any treatment. ,"The hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus and most infection occur through exposure to blood from unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, unscreened blood transfusions, injection drug use and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Globally, an estimated 50 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus infection, with about 1.0 million new infections occurring per year. ","WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2023, WHO focuses on the theme “One life, one liver” to illustrate the importance of the liver for a healthy life and the need to scale up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target. "
Hepatitis D,Key facts Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a virus that requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Chronic HDV occurs only in people living with HBV. HDV affects globally nearly 5% (an estimated 12 million) of people who have a chronic infection with HBV. Overview ,"Symptoms Simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe hepatitis with signs and symptoms of indistinguishable from those of other types of acute viral hepatitis infections. These features typically appear 3–7 weeks after initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes) and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete, development of fulminant hepatitis is infrequent, and progression to chronic hepatitis D is rare (less than 5% of acute hepatitis). ","Hepatitis D is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of HBV. HDV–HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. Vaccination against hepatitis B can prevent HDV infection. Geographical distribution ",Hepatitis D infection can be prevented by hepatitis B immunization. Novel treatment options with better safety profiles and outcomes are emerging and have been approved in Europe. ,"Treatment Until recently, pegylated interferon α (PEG-IFNα) had been the only treatment option for chronic HDV.  However, its use has been limited by poor treatment outcomes, side-effects and contraindications. Only about 20–30% of those treated with PEG-IFNα achieve complete virological response under treatment, and relapse is frequent. ","Additionally, WHO released updated Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2024. These guidelines now include formal recommendations for testing and confirmatory diagnosis of HDV. WHO is working as well to include the key HDV tests into its essential diagnostics list and is working with partners and member states to highlight the importance of a public health response to HDV. WHO organizes annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns (as 1 of its 9 flagship annual health campaigns) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis. For World Hepatitis Day 2024, WHO focused on the theme “It’s time for action” to illustrate the urgency of scaling up viral hepatitis prevention, testing and treatment to prevent liver diseases and cancer and achieve the 2030 hepatitis elimination target. "
Hepatitis E,Key facts ,"Symptoms The incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 weeks. The infected persons excretes the virus beginning from a few days before to 3–4 weeks after onset of the disease. ",Hepatitis E is an inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV). HEV caused 3450 deaths and there were an estimated 19.47 million cases of acute hepatitis E (AHE) globally in 2021; HEV was responsible for 5.4% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to acute hepatitis (1). ,A vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection is licensed in China and other countries and has been used as an outbreak response measure. Overview ,"Treatment There is no specific antiviral treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is generally not required. It is important to avoid unnecessary medications that can adversely affect liver function, for example acetaminophen (paracetamol). ","In March 2022, a significant milestone in the field of hepatitis E vaccination was achieved on the African continent. In response to the hepatitis E outbreak in Bentiu, South Sudan, Médecins Sans Frontières supported the South Sudan Ministry of Health to implement a hepatitis E vaccination campaign. Three vaccination rounds were conducted, immunizing more than 24 000 people per round, including pregnant women. This was the first ever use of the vaccine to mitigate the consequences of an outbreak, as recommended by WHO in its 2015 Hepatitis E vaccine position paper. A second campaign was put in place in 2023 to respond to an outbreak in Fangak County, Jonglei State, South Sudan. "
Herpes simplex virus,Key facts Overview ,"Most HSV infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized, but symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. An estimated 205 million people aged 15–49 (5.3%) experienced at least one symptomatic episode of genital herpes in 2020 (1). ","An estimated 3.8 billion people under age 50 (64%) globally have herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, the main cause of oral herpes. An estimated 520 million people aged 15–49 (13%) worldwide have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, the main cause of genital herpes. ",Prevention People with symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others (including oral sex) and sharing objects that touched saliva. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity while experiencing symptoms. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are most contagious when sores are present but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible. ,"Treatment Medicines are often used to treat first or recurrent symptomatic episodes (outbreaks) of herpes. They can decrease how long symptoms last and how severe they are, but they can’t cure the infection. ",Recurrent symptoms of both oral and genital herpes may be distressing. Genital herpes may also be stigmatizing and have an impact on sexual relationships. Symptoms 
HIV and AIDS,"Key facts HIV remains a major global public health issue, having claimed an estimated 42.3 million lives to date.  Transmission is ongoing in all countries globally. There were an estimated 39.9 million people living with HIV at the end of 2023, 65% of whom are in the WHO African Region. Overview ",Signs and symptoms The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. ,"In 2023, an estimated 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes and an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV. There is no cure for HIV infection. However, with access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, including for opportunistic infections, HIV infection has become a manageable chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives. ","HIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years. WHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease. ","By 2025, 95% of all people living with HIV should have a diagnosis, 95% of whom should be taking lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and 95% of people living with HIV on treatment should achieve a suppressed viral load for the benefit of the person’s health and for reducing onward HIV transmission. In 2023, these percentages were 86%, 89%, and 93% respectively. In 2023, of all people living with HIV, 86% knew their status, 77% were receiving antiretroviral therapy and 72% had suppressed viral loads. ",
HIV drug resistance,Key facts Overview ,,"HIV drug resistance is caused by changes in the genetic structure of HIV that affect the ability of medicines to block the replication of the virus. All antiretroviral drugs, including those from newer drug classes, are at risk of becoming partially or fully inactive due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus. If not prevented, HIV drug resistance can jeopardize the efficacy of medicines used to treat HIV (1), resulting in increased numbers of HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality (2). Scope of the problem ","As the use of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) is scaled up, remaining vigilant in preventing and monitoring HIV drug resistance among infants newly diagnosed with HIV is imperative. The prevalence of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-associated resistance (defined as resistance to tenofovir and/or lamivudine) is low for individuals who acquire HIV while receiving tenofovir-containing PrEP. However, the prevalence of tenofovir and or lamivudine resistance is more than 10-fold higher if PrEP is initiated during undiagnosed acute HIV infection. ","The emergence of acquired resistance to Dolutegravir (DTG) – the preferred antiretroviral drug – may be higher than anticipated, especially in people with heavy prior treatment experience. Despite the emergence of resistance, DTG is a highly effective drug in HIV treatment, with more than 90% of patients achieving sustained viral suppression if adherent to treatment. ","prevention and response: implement high-impact interventions to prevent and respond to HIV drug resistance, including an emphasis on dolutegravir-based antiretroviral regimens, monitoring HIV care service delivery, and strategies to ensure uninterrupted drug supplies; monitoring and surveillance: obtain quality data on HIV drug resistance and HIV service delivery from periodic surveys while expanding routine viral load and HIV drug resistance testing; "
Household air pollution,"Key facts Around 2.1 billion people worldwide (around a third of the global population) cook using open fires or inefficient stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal, which generates harmful household air pollution. Household air pollution was responsible for an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year in 2020, including over 237 000 deaths of children under the age of 5. ",,"Each year, 3.2 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributable to the household air pollution caused by the incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking (see household air pollution data for details). Particulate matter and other pollutants in household air pollution inflame the airways and lungs, impair immune response and reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Among these 3.2 million deaths from household air pollution exposure: ","It is essential to expand use of clean fuels and technologies to reduce household air pollution and protect health. These include solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Overview ","convenes the global Health and Energy Platform of Action (HEPA), which strengthens cooperation between the health and energy sectors to ensure universal access to clean and sustainable energy for households and health-care facilities in order to protect health; works with countries, researchers and other partners to harmonize methods of planning and evaluation across settings for consistent and rigorous household energy and health assessments; ","In light of the widespread use of polluting fuels and stoves for cooking, WHO issued a set of normative guidance, the Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion, which offer practical evidence-based guidance on what fuels and technologies used in the home can be considered clean, including recommendations discouraging use of kerosene and recommending against use of unprocessed coal; specifying the performance of fuels and technologies (in the form of emission rate targets) needed to protect health; and emphasizing the importance of addressing all household energy uses, particularly cooking, space heating and lighting to ensure benefits for health and the environment. WHO defines fuels and technologies that are clean for health at the point of use as solar, electricity, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, alcohol fuels, as well as biomass stoves that meet the emission targets in the WHO Guidelines. Without strong policy action, 1.8 billion people are estimated to still lack access to clean fuels and technologies in 2030 (1). There is a particularly critical need for action in sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth has outpaced access to clean cooking, and 923 million people lacked access in 2022. Strategies to increase the adoption of clean household energy include policies that provide financial support to purchase cleaner technologies and fuels, improved ventilation or housing design, and communication campaigns to encourage clean energy use.

Human papillomavirus and cancer,Key facts ,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms. HPV can affect the skin, genital area and throat. ","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the name of a group of 200 known viruses. They do not cause concerns in most people, but infection with some high-risk types is common and can cause genital warts or cancer. In 90% of people the body controls the infection by itself. Persistent HPV infection with high-risk HPV types is the cause of cervical cancer and is associated with cancers of the vulva, vagina, mouth/throat, penis and anus (1). ","Prophylactic vaccination against HPV can prevent these cancers. In addition, HPV-screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions is an effective way to prevent cervical cancer. Overview ","HPV usually goes away on its own without treatment. Some HPV infections cause genital warts. Others can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer. Cancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccines. ",
Human rights,"Key facts Human rights are universal rights of all human beings, regardless of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The right to health and other health-related human rights are legally binding commitments enshrined in international human rights instruments. WHO’s Constitution also recognizes the right to health. ",,"Every human being has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Countries have a legal obligation to develop and implement legislation and policies that guarantee universal access to quality health services and address the root causes of health disparities, including poverty, stigma and discrimination. The right to health is indivisible from other human rights, including the rights to education, participation, food, housing, work and information. ","Human rights are enshrined in human rights instruments. All WHO Member States have ratified at least one international human rights treaty that includes the right to the highest attainable standard of health.    After ratifying a treaty, a country has a legal obligation to protect and fulfil the rights recognized in the treaty. To deliver on binding human rights commitments countries need to adopt a human rights-based approach to health. Health and human rights ","Universal health coverage (UHC) grounded in primary health care helps countries realize the right to health by ensuring all people have affordable, equitable access to health services. Overview ","There is a growing recognition of the importance of regulation of non-State actors, such as the private sector and non-governmental organizations, to ensure they respect and protect human rights. For example, by enacting bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS), countries are implementing their commitments to manage tobacco control under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. One third of countries (66), representing a quarter of the world’s population, have completely banned all forms of TAPS. Progressive realization and international cooperation "
Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1,Key facts ,"Symptoms and complications Most people with HTLV-1 infection do not have symptoms. About 5–10% of people with HTLV-1 will develop a recognized associated clinical condition. Early clinical manifestations may be uveitis, dermatitis and pneumonitis. ","Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus which causes a chronic lifelong infection in humans. HTLV-1 is primarily transmitted through breast feeding, sexual contact and, needle sharing and unsafe blood transfusion. ",There is no effective treatment for HTLV-1 and emphasis is placed on detection and prevention. Overview ,"Treatment There is currently no treatment for HTLV-1 infection. Treatment focuses on managing associated conditions and includes corticosteroids, immune modulating drugs and chemotherapy. ",
Hypertension,"Key facts An estimated 1.28 billion adults aged 30–79 years worldwide have hypertension, most (two-thirds) living in low- and middle-income countries An estimated 46% of adults with hypertension are unaware that they have the condition. Overview ",People with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked. Things that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include: ,Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide. One of the global targets for noncommunicable diseases is to reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 33% between 2010 and 2030. ,ACE inhibitors including enalapril and lisinopril relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage. Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) including losartan and telmisartan relax blood vessels and prevent kidney damage. ,"If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately. The only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure. Having blood pressure measured is quick and painless. Although individuals can measure their own blood pressure using automated devices, an evaluation by a health professional is important for assessment of risk and associated conditions. ",
ICD-11,"What is ICD–11? ICD–11 is the international standard for systematic recording, reporting, analysis, interpretation and comparison of mortality and morbidity data. This 11th revision is the result of an unprecedented collaboration with clinicians, statisticians, classification and IT experts from around the world, making it useable by these groups, as well as by coders. ",,"Coding for traffic accidents and causes of injuries is now consistent with current international practice for data documentation and analysis. The creation of extension codes allows flexible addition of detail relevant for clinical documentation, and device or substance safety. Extension codes provide for the recording of medicaments with WHO INN[2] and WHO Medical Device nomenclature, as well as documenting the severity of conditions, anatomy or histopathology. ","ICD–11 is a vast improvement on previous revisions. It reflects critical advances in science and medicine, aligning classification with the latest knowledge of disease treatment and prevention. There is more meaningful clinical content than ICD–10. A significant feature of ICD–11 is the improved ease and accuracy of coding requiring less user training than ever before, together with the availability of online and offline functioning. ICD–11 is digital health ready, for use in multiple IT-environments, with a new API. It is presented together with a suite of web services, including multilingual support and in-built user guidance. ","All concepts for recording and reporting in primary care are included. Overall coding improvements in ICD–11 allow more precise and more detailed data recording and collection. However, newly available clinical precision is possible. Examples include: ","ICD–11 allows countries to count and identify their most pressing health issues by using an up-to-date and clinically relevant classification system. Health conditions and accidents are assigned ICD–11 codes, resulting in data that can be used by governments to design effective public health policies, and measure their impact, or used for clinical recording. For the first time, ICD is fully electronic, currently providing access to 17 000 diagnostic categories, with over 100 000 medical diagnostic index terms. The index-based search algorithm interprets more than 1.6 million terms. ICD–11 is easy to install and use online or offline, using free 'container' software. "
Immunization coverage,"Key facts Globally in 2023, there were 14.5 million children missing out on any vaccination – so-called zero-dose children. Overview ",,"During 2023, about 84% of infants worldwide (108 million) received 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, protecting them against infectious diseases that can cause serious illness and disability or be fatal. However, these global figures hide significant disparity among countries of different income strata, with low-income countries lagging behind. Measles, because of its high transmissibility, acts as an early warning system, quickly exposing immunity gaps in the population. Still, 22.2 million children missed their routine first dose of measles, far from the 2019 level of 19.3 million. ","Coverage of a third dose of vaccine protecting against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3) was 84% in 2023. The proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 83% in 2023, well below the 2019 level of 86%. ",,
Infant and young child feeding,"Undernutrition is estimated to be associated with 2.7 million child deaths annually or 45% of all child deaths. Infant and young child feeding is a key area to improve child survival and promote healthy growth and development. The first 2 years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall. Optimal breastfeeding is so critical that it could save the lives of over 820 000 children under the age of 5 years each year. WHO and UNICEF recommend: ",,,"Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits for the infant and mother. Chief among these is protection against gastrointestinal infections which is observed not only in developing but also industrialized countries. Early initiation of breastfeeding, within 1 hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infections and reduces newborn mortality. The risk of mortality due to diarrhoea and other infections can increase in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Breast-milk is also an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged 6–23 months. It can provide half or more of a child’s energy needs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months. Breast milk is also a critical source of energy and nutrients during illness, and reduces mortality among children who are malnourished.

Infertility,Key facts ,,"In the male reproductive system, infertility is most commonly caused by problems in the ejection of semen, absence or low levels of sperm, or abnormal shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm. In the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by a range of abnormalities of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and the endocrine system, among others. ","Fertility care encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Equal and equitable access to fertility care remains a challenge in most countries; particularly in low and middle-income countries. Fertility care is rarely prioritized in national universal health coverage benefit packages. Overview ","Infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Infertility may occur due to male, female or unexplained factors. Some causes of infertility are preventable. Treatment of infertility often involves in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other types of medically assisted reproduction. What causes infertility? ","Infertility affects millions of people – and has an impact on their families and communities. Estimates suggest that approximately one in every six people of reproductive age worldwide experience infertility in their lifetime. In the male reproductive system, infertility is most commonly caused by problems in the ejection of semen, absence or low levels of sperm, or abnormal shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm. "
Influenza (avian and other zoonotic),"Key facts Humans can be infected with avian, swine and other influenza viruses. Direct contact with infected animals (through handling, culling, slaughtering or processing) or indirect contact (through environments contaminated with bodily fluids from infected animals) represent a risk for human infection. Overview ","Exposure to animal influenza viruses can lead to infection and disease in humans – ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms or eye inflammation to severe, acute respiratory disease and/or death. Disease severity will depend upon the virus causing the infection and the characteristics of the infected individual. Currently circulating zoonotic influenza viruses have not yet demonstrated sustained person-to-person transmission. ","There are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease in humans although only type A viruses can cause global pandemics based on current knowledge and understanding. Influenza A viruses are established in many animal species. The emergence of an influenza A virus, with the ability to infect people and sustain human-to-human transmission, could cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. When animal influenza viruses infect their host species, they are named according to the host – as avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, equine influenza viruses, canine influenza viruses, etc. These animal influenza viruses are distinct from human influenza viruses and do not easily transmit to and among humans. ","If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities should be notified and appropriate clinical case management provided, including testing, triage, clinical assessment for disease severity classification, assessment of risk factors for severe disease, and isolation and treatment (for example, with antivirals and supportive care). Patients with influenza should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. Prevention ","Treatment If a person is suspected of having zoonotic influenza, the health authorities should be notified and appropriate clinical case management provided, including testing, triage, clinical assessment for disease severity classification, assessment of risk factors for severe disease, and isolation and treatment (for example, with antivirals and supportive care). Patients with influenza should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. ",Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for most subtypes of influenza A viruses. Avian influenza outbreaks in poultry can have immediate and severe consequences for the agricultural sector. Pandemic potential 
Influenza (seasonal),"Key facts There are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, including 3–5 million cases of severe illness. ",Symptoms begin 1–4 days after infection and usually last around a week. Overview ,It causes 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths annually. Ninety-nine percent of deaths in children under 5 years of age with influenza-related lower respiratory tract infections are in developing countries. ,"Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. Symptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue. ",Seasonal influenza (the flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment. Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. ,"Influenza C virus is detected less frequently and usually causes mild infections, thus does not present public health importance. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people. "
Injuries and violence,Overview ,,"Injuries result from road traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns, poisoning and acts of violence against oneself or others, among other causes. Of the 4.4 million injury-related deaths, unintentional injuries take the lives of 3.16 million people every year and violence-related injuries kill 1.25 million people every year. Roughly 1 in 3 of these deaths result from road traffic crashes, 1 in 6 from suicide, 1 in 10 from homicide and 1 in 61 from war and conflict. ","Beyond death and injury, exposure to any form of trauma, particularly in childhood, can increase the risk of mental illness and suicide; smoking, alcohol and substance abuse; chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer; and social problems such as poverty, crime and violence. For these reasons, preventing injuries and violence, including by breaking intergenerational cycles of violence, goes beyond avoiding the physical injury to contributing to substantial health, social and economic gains. Injuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries; however, they are not evenly distributed across or within countries – some people are more vulnerable than others depending on the conditions in which they are born, grow, work, live and age. For instance, in general, being young, male and of low socioeconomic status all increase the risk of injury and of being a victim or perpetrator of serious physical violence. The risk of fall-related injuries increases with age. ","Tens of millions more people suffer non-fatal injuries each year which lead to emergency department and acute care visits, hospitalizations or treatment by general practitioners and often result in temporary or permanent disability and the need for long-term physical and mental health care and rehabilitation. For example, there has been a significant rise in road traffic injuries in the African region since 2000, with an almost 50% increase in healthy life-years lost. Impact ","Risk factors and determinants common to all types of injuries include alcohol or substance use; inadequate adult supervision of children; and broad societal determinants of health such as poverty; economic and gender inequality; unemployment; a lack of safety in the built environment, including unsafe housing, schools, roads and workplaces; inadequate product safety standards and regulations; easy access to alcohol, drugs, firearms, knives and pesticides; weak social safety nets; frail criminal justice systems; and inadequate institutional policies to address injuries in a consistent and effective manner, in part due to the availability of sufficient resources. In settings where emergency trauma care services are weak or there is inequitable access to services, the consequences of injuries and violence can be exacerbated. Prevention "
Ionizing radiation and health effects,"What is ionizing radiation? Ionizing radiation is a type of energy released by atoms that travels in the form of electromagnetic waves (gamma or X-rays) or particles (neutrons, beta or alpha). The spontaneous disintegration of atoms is called radioactivity, and the excess energy emitted is a form of ionizing radiation. Unstable elements which disintegrate and emit ionizing radiation are called radionuclides. All radionuclides are uniquely identified by the type of radiation they emit, the energy of the radiation, and their half-life. ",,"If the radiation dose is low and/or it is delivered over a long period of time (low dose rate), the risk is substantially low because there is a greater likelihood of repairing the damage. There is still a risk of long-term effects such as cataract or cancer, however, that may appear years or even decades later. Effects of this type will not always occur, but their likelihood is proportional to the radiation dose. This risk is higher for children and adolescents as they are significantly more sensitive to radiation exposure than adults. Epidemiological studies on populations exposed to radiation, such as the survivors of the atomic bombings or radiotherapy patients, showed a significant increase of cancer risk at doses above 100 mSv. More recently, some epidemiological studies in individuals exposed to medical exposure during childhood (paediatric CT) have suggested that cancer risk may increase even at lower doses (between 50-100 mSv). ","Exposure to ionizing radiation can be classified for radiation protection purposes into three exposure situations, i.e. planned, existing and emergency situations. Planned exposure situations result from the deliberate introduction and operation of radiation sources with specific purposes, as is the case with the medical use of radiation for diagnosis or treatment of patients, or the use of radiation in industry or research. Existing exposure occurs where radiation already exists and a decision on control must be taken – for example, exposure to radon in homes or workplaces or exposure to natural background radiation from the environment. Emergency exposure situations result from unexpected events requiring prompt response, such as nuclear accidents or malicious acts. Medical use of radiation accounts for 98 % of the population dose contribution from all human-made sources, and represents 20% of the total population exposure. Annually worldwide, more than 4200 million diagnostic radiology examinations are performed, 40 million nuclear medicine procedures are carried out, and 8.5 million radiotherapy treatments are given. ","Exposure to radiation also comes from human-made sources ranging from nuclear power generation to medical uses of radiation for diagnosis or treatment. Today, the most common human-made sources of ionizing radiation are medical devices, including x-ray machines and Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. Exposure to ionizing radiation ",
Japanese encephalitis,"Key facts Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by mosquitoes (especially Culex tritaeniorhynchus). ","Signs and symptoms Most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. The incubation period is 4–14 days. In children, gastrointestinal pain and vomiting may be the dominant initial symptoms. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with disease symptoms. Of those who survive, 20–30% suffer permanent cognitive, behavioural or neurological sequelae such as seizures,  hearing or vision loss, speech, language, memory, and communication problems or weakness of the limbs. ","JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 100 000 clinical cases every year (1). Although symptomatic Japanese encephalitis (JE) is rare, the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%. Permanent neurologic, cognitive and behavioural sequelae occur in 30–50% of those with encephalitis. ",Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent JE. WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue. Overview ,There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent JE. WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue. ,"Those who have lived through encephalitis often have health-care needs requiring long-term treatment and care including rehabilitation. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from encephalitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of sequelae on people with encephalitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Individuals and families with members disabled by encephalitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by encephalitis are able to live full and rewarding lives. Prevention and control "
Lassa fever,Key facts ,"About 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no or mild symptoms. One in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys. Because the clinical course of the disease is very variable, detection of the disease in affected patients has been difficult. When presence of the disease is confirmed in a community, early detection and prompt isolation and care of patients, good infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings, and promoting community hygiene and rodent prevention, can prevent further spread of the disease. ","Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that is caused by Lassa virus. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but probably exists in other west African countries as well. ","Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in health care settings lacking adequate infection prevention and control measures. The overall case fatality rate is 1% but observed case fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe diseases of Lassa fever is 15% and above. ",Early intensive supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves chances of survival. Overview ,
Lead poisoning,"Key facts Exposure to lead can affect multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children and women of child-bearing age. Lead is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it can accumulate over time. Human exposure is assessed through the measurement of lead in blood. ","Lead exposure can have serious consequences for the health of children. Exposure to very high levels of lead can severely damage the brain and central nervous system causing coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent intellectual disability and behavioural disorders. At lower levels of exposure that may have no obvious symptoms, lead can lead to a spectrum of injury across multiple body systems. In particular, lead can permanently affect children’s brain development, resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes including reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, and reduced educational attainment. Lead exposure also causes anaemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs. There is no known safe blood lead concentration; even blood lead concentrations as low as 3.5 µg/dL may be associated with decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems (1). ","Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust. Its widespread use has caused extensive environmental contamination, human exposure and significant public health problems globally. Important sources of environmental contamination include mining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and lead use in a range of products. Most global lead consumption is for the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles. Lead is used in many products, including pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, toys, some traditional cosmetics, and some traditional medicines. Lead can contaminate drinking water through plumbing systems containing lead pipes, solders and fittings. ",The harmful impacts on health from lead exposure are entirely preventable. Overview ,"In 2021, WHO published Guidelines on clinical management exposure to lead. The guidelines recommend that for individuals with blood lead concentration equal to or greater than 5 µg/dL, the source of lead exposure should be identified, and appropriate action taken to terminate exposure. Lead paint is a major source of exposure globally. WHO and UNEP lead the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. It aims to encourage all countries to develop legally binding laws to control the use of lead in paint. As of January 2024, 48% of countries have legally-binding controls on lead paint. ","Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead and can suffer permanent adverse health impacts, particularly on the development of the central nervous system. Lead causes long-term harm in adults, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage. Lead exposure during pregnancy can cause reduced fetal growth and preterm birth. Sources and routes of exposure "
Legionellosis,Overview ,Symptoms Legionellosis is a generic term describing the pneumonic and non-pneumonic forms of infection with Legionella. ,"Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to the Legionella bacteria species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. Cases of legionellosis are often categorized as being community, travel or hospital acquired based on the type of exposure. ","Prevention of Legionnaires’ disease depends on applying control measures to minimize the growth of Legionella and dissemination of aerosols. These measures include good maintenance of devices, including regular cleaning and disinfection and applying other physical (temperature) or chemical measures (biocide) to minimize growth. Some examples are: the regular maintenance, cleaning and disinfection of cooling towers together with frequent or continuous addition of biocides; ","Risk factors for hospital-acquired pneumonia are recent surgery, intubation (the process of placing a tube in the trachea), mechanical ventilation, aspiration, presence of nasogastric tubes, and the use of respiratory therapy equipment. The most susceptible hosts are immuno-compromised patients, including organ transplant recipients and cancer patients and those receiving corticosteroid treatment. Delay in diagnosis and administration of appropriate antibiotic treatment, increasing age and presence of co-existing diseases are predictors of death from Legionnaires’ disease. ",
Leishmaniasis,Overview ,,"Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoa parasite from over 20 Leishmania species. Over 90 sandfly species are known to transmit Leishmania parasites. There are 3 main forms of the disease: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. It is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anaemia. Most cases occur in Brazil, east Africa and India. An estimated 50 000 to 90 000 new cases of VL occur worldwide annually, with only 25–45% reported to WHO. It has outbreak and mortality potential. ",Prevention and control Preventing and controlling the spread of leishmaniasis is complex and requires many tools. Key strategies include: ,"People living with HIV and who are infected with leishmaniasis have high chances of developing the full-blown disease,  high relapse and mortality rates. Antiretroviral treatment reduces the development of the disease, delays relapses and increases the survival. As of 2021, Leishmania-HIV coinfection has been reported from 45 countries. High  coinfection rates are reported from Brazil, Ethiopia and the state of Bihar ( India). In 2022, WHO published new treatment recommendations for Leishmania-HIV coinfected patients in east Africa and South-East Asia. Major risk factors ","monitoring disease trends and assessing the impact of control activities through the web-based global surveillance system which will allow for raising awareness and advocacy on the global burden of leishmaniasis and promoting equitable access to health services; developing evidence-based policy strategies and standards for leishmaniasis prevention and control, including capacity building such as online courses at Neglected Tropical Diseases (openwho.org); "
Leprosy,Key facts Overview ,,"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria, Mycobacterium leprae. The disease predominantly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Left untreated, the disease may cause progressive and permanent disabilities. ","Leprosy, also known as Hansen disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused mainly by a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae. The disease affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Apart from the physical deformity, persons affected by leprosy also face stigmatization and discrimination. However, leprosy is curable and treatment in the early stages can prevent disability. Scope of the problem ","The disease is believed to be transmitted through droplets from the nose and mouth of an untreated case of leprosy, containing the causative agent, following prolonged, close contact. The disease does not spread through casual contact (like shaking hands or hugging, sharing meals or sitting next to each other). The patient stops transmitting the disease upon initiation of treatment. Diagnosis ",
Listeriosis,"L. monocytogenes are ubiquitous in nature and found in soil, water and animal digestive tracts. Vegetables may be contaminated through soil or the use of manure as fertilizer. Ready-to-eat food can also become contaminated during processing and the bacteria can multiply to dangerous levels during distribution and storage. ","Noninvasive listeriosis (febrile listerial gastroenteritis) is a mild form of the disease affecting mainly otherwise healthy people. Symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, headache and myalgia (muscle pain). The incubation period is short (a few days). Outbreaks of this disease have generally involved the ingestion of foods containing high doses of L. monocytogenes. Invasive listeriosis is a more severe form of the disease and affects certain high risk groups of the population. These include pregnant women, patients undergoing treatment for cancer, HIV and organ transplants, elderly people and infants. This form of disease is characterized by severe symptoms and a high mortality rate (20–30%). The symptoms include fever, myalgia (muscle pain), septicemia, meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks but can vary between a few days and up to 90 days. ","Foodborne listeriosis is one of the most serious and severe foodborne diseases. It is caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. It is a relatively rare disease with 0.1 to 10 cases per 1 million people per year depending on the countries and regions of the world. Although the number of cases of listeriosis is small, the high rate of death associated with this infection makes it a significant public health concern. Unlike many other common foodborne diseases causing bacteria, L. monocytogenescan survive and multiply at low temperatures usually found in refrigerators. Eating contaminated food with high numbers of L. monocytogenes is the main route of infection. Infection can also be transmitted between humans, notably from pregnant women to unborn babies. ","Listeriosis can be treated if diagnosed early. Antibiotics are used to treat severe symptoms such as meningitis. When infection occurs during pregnancy, prompt administration of antibiotics prevents infection of the fetus or newborn. Control methods ","foods that are consumed without further treatment, such as cooking, which would otherwise kill L. monocytogenes. In past outbreaks, foods involved included ready-to-eat meat products, such as frankfurters, meat spread (paté), smoked salmon and fermented raw meat sausages, as well as dairy products (including soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk and ice cream) and prepared salads (including coleslaw and bean sprouts) as well as fresh vegetables and fruits.

Low back pain,"Overview Low back pain (LBP) describes pain between the lower edge of the ribs and the buttock. It can last for a short time (acute), a little longer (sub-acute) or a long time (chronic). It can affect anyone. LBP makes it hard to move and can affect quality of life and mental well-being. It can limit work activities and engagement with family and friends. ","Signs and symptoms Low back pain can be a dull ache or sharp pain. It can also cause pain to radiate into other areas of the body, especially the legs. ","LBP can be specific or non-specific. Specific LBP is pain that is caused by a certain disease or structural problem in the spine, or when the pain radiates from another part of the body. Non-specific LBP is when it isn’t possible to identify a specific disease or structural reason to explain the pain. LBP is non-specific in about 90% of cases. ",There are several ways to reduce symptoms and help prevent further episodes of non-specific low back pain: being physically active ,"In all types and at all stages of LBP, rehabilitation is essential to reassure people and help them make sense of their pain, help them return to activities they enjoy and identify strategies to support recovery and improve function. Specialized care pathways may be needed for specific LBP. An estimated 619 million people live with LBP and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. LBP is a major public health issue. LBP is often associated with loss of work productivity and thus produces huge economic burden on individuals and on societies. ","People at any age can experience LBP, including children and adolescents. Most people experience LBP at some point in their lives. The peak in the number of cases occurs at 50–55 years, and women experience LBP more frequently than men. The prevalence and disability impact of LBP are greatest among older people aged 80–85 years. Recurrent LBP episodes are more common with ageing. Chronic LBP is a major cause of work loss and participation restriction and reduced quality of life around the world. Considering the high prevalence, LBP contributes to a huge economic burden on societies. It should be considered a global public health problem that requires an appropriate response. "
Lung cancer,Overview ,"Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath. It is important to seek medical care early to avoid serious health effects. Treatments depend on the person’s medical history and the stage of the disease. ","Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts when abnormal cells grow in an uncontrolled way in the lungs. It is a serious health issue that can cause severe harm and death. Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath. ",Prevention Not smoking tobacco is the best way to prevent lung cancer. ,"Early treatment can prevent lung cancer from becoming worse and spreading to other parts of the body. Prevention of lung cancer include primary and secondary prevention measures. Primary prevention aims to prevent the initial occurrence of a disease through risk reduction and promoting healthy behaviour. In public health, these preventive measures include smoking cessation, promoting smoke-free environments, implementing tobacco control policies, addressing occupational hazards, and reducing air pollution levels. ","WHO recognizes the significant impact of lung cancer on global health and has implemented several initiatives to address the disease comprehensively. The WHO's response focuses on tobacco control, cancer prevention, early detection, and improving access to quality treatment and care. WHO supports countries in implementing evidence-based tobacco control policies, including increasing tobacco taxes, enforcing comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, and implementing strong graphic health warnings on tobacco products. The Organization also promotes cancer prevention strategies by advocating for healthy lifestyles, including regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and minimizing exposure to environmental risk factors. Additionally, WHO supports early detection programs and encourages countries to implement screening measures for high-risk populations to detect lung cancer at earlier stages when treatment options are more effective. Last, WHO works towards ensuring access to quality treatment and care for lung cancer patients by providing technical guidance to member states, promoting equitable access to essential cancer medicines, and fostering international collaboration to share best practices and improve cancer care outcomes. "
Lymphatic filariasis,"Key facts Lymphatic filariasis impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. ","Symptoms Lymphatic filariasis infection involves asymptomatic, acute and chronic conditions. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection while contributing to the transmission of the parasite. These asymptomatic infections still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and alter the body's immune system. ","An essential, recommended package of care can alleviate suffering and prevent further disability among people living with disease caused by lymphatic filariasis. Overview ",Over 657 million people in 39 countries worldwide remain threatened by lymphatic filariasis and require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of this parasitic infection. Lymphatic filariasis can be eliminated by stopping the spread of infection through preventive chemotherapy with safe medicine combinations repeated annually. More than 9.7 billion cumulative treatments have been delivered to stop the spread of infection since 2000. ,"When lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). Involvement of breasts and genital organs is common. Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The socioeconomic burdens of isolation and poverty are immense. Acute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels often accompany chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the body's immune response to the parasite. Most are the result of secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage. These acute attacks are debilitating, may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people suffering with lymphatic filariasis. ","The impact of MDA depends on the efficacy of the regimen and the coverage (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines). MDA with the 2-medicine regimens have interrupted the transmission cycle when conducted annually for at least 4–6 years with effective coverage of the total population at risk. Salt fortified with DEC has also been used in a few unique settings to interrupt the transmission cycle. At the start of GPELF, 81 countries were considered endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Further epidemiological data reviewed since, indicate that preventive chemotherapy was not required in 10 countries. From 2000 to 2023, 9.7 billion cumulative treatments were delivered to more than 943 million people at least once in 71 countries, considerably reducing transmission in many places. The population requiring MDA has declined by 58.6% (871 million) where infection prevalence has been reduced below elimination thresholds. The overall economic benefit of the programme during 2000–2007 is conservatively estimated at US$ 24 billion. Treatments until 2015 are estimated to have averted at least US$ 100.5 billion of economic loss expected to have occurred over the lifetime of cohorts who have benefited from treatment. "
Malaria,"Key facts Globally in 2023, there were an estimated 263 million malaria cases and 597 000 malaria deaths in 83 countries. The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. Overview ","Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women and girls, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. ","The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person. Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing. ",Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable. The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person. ,"Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse. Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours. ","Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria. Preventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines. "
Malnutrition,"Key facts Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases. In 2022, 2.5 billion adults were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity, while 390 million were underweight. Overview ",,"Low weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight. A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. ","providing social protection and nutrition-related education for all; aligning health systems to nutrition needs, and providing universal coverage of essential nutrition interventions; ","Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health. The United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition ","Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. The developmental, economic, social and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting, for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries. The developmental, economic, social and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting, for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries. "
Marburg virus disease,"Key facts Marburg virus disease (MVD), formerly known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The average MVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks. Overview ",People cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms and remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of Marburg virus disease ,"Both viruses are part of the Filoviridae family (filovirus) to which Orthoebolavirus genus belongs. Though caused by different viruses, Ebola and Marburg diseases are clinically similar. Both diseases are rare but have the capacity to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates. MVD was initially detected in 1967 after two simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. These outbreaks were associated with laboratory work using African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with recent travel history to Zimbabwe), Tanzania and Uganda. In 2008, two independent cases were reported in travellers who had visited a cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus bat colonies in Uganda. In September 2024, Rwanda reported the country's first outbreak and Tanzania declared another outbreak in January 2025. ","Prevention and control Community engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreaks. Outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as case management, surveillance and contact tracing, good laboratory service, infection prevention and control in health facilities, safe and dignified burials and social mobilization. ","Early supportive care with rehydration, and symptomatic treatment improves survival. There are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments for MVD, but a range of vaccines and drug therapies are under development. ",
Maternal mortality,Key facts ,,"Every day in 2023, over 700 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. A maternal death occurred almost every 2 minutes in 2023. ","Maternal mortality is unacceptably high. About 260 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2023. Approximately 92% of all maternal deaths occurred in low- and lower-middle-income countries in 2023, and most could have been prevented. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions and sub-regions are used here. Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia accounted for around 87% (225 000) of the estimated global maternal deaths in 2023. Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for around 70% of maternal deaths (182 000), while southern Asia accounted for around 17% (43 000). ","Care by skilled health professionals before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborns. Overview ","What was the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal mortality? The MMR rose in 2021 (from 282 000 maternal deaths in 2020 to 322 000 maternal deaths in 2021). It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this via two mechanisms: (i) indirect obstetric deaths – where the woman had SARS-CoV-2 infection and died as a result of the interaction between COVID-19 and her pregnant state; and/or (ii) direct obstetric deaths – where disruptions to health services hindered access to and/or quality of care resulting in pregnancy complications that ended in mortality, when they may otherwise have been prevented or managed successfully (4). The data show that this interruption to the downward trajectory of global MMR was short-lived. In 2022, the global MMR and number of maternal deaths were lower than they had been in the three years immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. "
Measles,Key facts Overview ,"Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus. ","Measles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can lead to severe complications and death. Measles vaccination averted more than 60 million deaths between 2000 and 2023. ","Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 2000–2023. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2022 (1). Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic ","We must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps. Signs and symptoms ","In 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021–2030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system’s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines. WHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals. "
Meningitis,Key facts Meningitis is a devastating disease that can be deadly and often results in serious long-term health issues. Meningitis remains a major global public health challenge. ,"Signs and symptoms The symptoms of meningitis can differ based on the cause, how quickly the disease progresses, how long it lasts, brain involvement, and other serious complications like sepsis. ","Many organisms can cause meningitis, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Bacterial meningitis is of particular concern. Around 1 in 6 people who get this type of meningitis die and 1 in 5 have severe complications. ",Vaccines are the most effective way to deliver long-lasting protection. Overview ,"Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can be infectious or non-infectious in origin, can be associated with high risk of death and long-term complications, and requires urgent medical care. Meningitis remains a significant global health threat. It can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases. ","Bacterial meningitis is the most serious type of meningitis. It is a severe, life-threatening condition that can often lead to long-term adverse health consequences. There are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) "
Menopause,Key facts ,A variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions can help alleviate perimenopausal symptoms. Overview ,"Menopause is caused by the loss of ovarian follicular function and a decline in circulating blood oestrogen levels. The menopausal transition can be gradual, usually beginning with changes in the menstrual cycle. Perimenopause refers to the period from when these signs are first observed and ends one year after the final menstrual period. ","During perimenopause and following menopause, it is still possible to acquire sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, through unprotected sexual contact, including oral, anal and vaginal sex. The thinning of the vaginal wall after menopause increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of HIV transmission during vaginal sex. The importance of understanding menopause ","Menopause is one point in a continuum of life stages for women and marks the end of their reproductive years. After menopause, a woman cannot become pregnant, except in rare cases when specialized fertility treatments are used. Most women experience menopause between the ages of 45 and 55 years as a natural part of biological ageing. Menopause can also be a consequence of surgical or medical procedures. ","Menopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both ovaries or medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy). Many women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had certain surgical procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain hormonal contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods. They may still experience other changes related to the menopausal transition. "
Mental disorders,"A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.  It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders.  Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm.  This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). ","In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents (1).  Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered. Depression ","In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2). While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights. Anxiety Disorders ","At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community, and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability, and inequality – are at higher risk. Protective and risk factors include individual psychological and biological factors, such as emotional skills as well as genetics.  Many of the risk and protective factors are influenced through changes in brain structure and/or function. Health systems and social support ","In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents (1). Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered. Bipolar Disorder ","Neurodevelopmental disorders include disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) amongst others. ADHD is characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning.  Disorders of intellectual development are characterised by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, which refers to difficulties with everyday conceptual, social, and practical skills that are performed in daily life. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a diverse group of conditions characterised by some degree of difficulty with social communication and reciprocal social interaction, as well as persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Effective treatment options exist including psychosocial interventions, behavioural interventions, occupational and speech therapy. For certain diagnoses and age groups, medication may also be considered. "
Mental health,"Concepts in mental health Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development. Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes. ",,,"Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or undermine our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum. Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems. ","Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments. School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels. Promoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers. ",
Mental health at work,"Key facts Decent work is good for mental health. Poor working environments – including discrimination and inequality, excessive workloads, low job control and job insecurity – pose a risk to mental health. ","interventions for individuals to build skills to manage stress and reduce mental health symptoms, including psychosocial interventions and opportunities for leisure-based physical activity. Support people with mental health conditions to participate in and thrive at work ","Although psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work. Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health. Economic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment. ","There are effective actions to prevent mental health risks at work, protect and promote mental health at work, and support workers with mental health conditions. Overview ","At work, risks to mental health, also called psychosocial risks, may be related to job content or work schedule, specific characteristics of the workplace or opportunities for career development among other things. Risks to mental health at work can include: ",
Mental health in emergencies,"Key facts Almost all people affected by emergencies experience psychological distress, which typically improves over time. One in five people (22%) who have experienced war or conflict in the previous 10 years has depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Overview ",,,"Protect and promote the rights of people with severe mental health conditions, including those living in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals, social care homes and rehabilitation clinics for substance use. Establish referral networks between mental health specialists, general health care providers, community supports and other relevant services (e.g. schools, social services and emergency relief services). ",Emergencies significantly disrupt mental health services and reduce the availability of quality care. People with severe mental health conditions are especially vulnerable during emergencies and need access to mental health care and other basic needs. ,"Every year, millions of people are affected by emergencies such as armed conflicts and natural disasters. These crises disrupt families, livelihoods and essential services, and significantly impact mental health. Nearly all those affected experience psychological distress. A minority go on to develop mental health conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Emergencies can worsen mental health conditions and social issues such as poverty and discrimination. They can also contribute to new problems, such as family separation and harmful substance use. "
Mental health of adolescents,"Key facts Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 15% of the global burden of disease in this age group. ","Emotional disorders are common among adolescents. Anxiety disorders (which may involve panic or excessive worry) are the most prevalent in this age group and are more common among older than among younger adolescents. It is estimated that 4.4% of 10–14-year-olds and 5.5% of 15–19-year-olds experience an anxiety disorder (1). Depression is estimated to occur among 1.4% of adolescents aged 10–14 years, and 3.5% of 15–19-year-olds (1). Depression and anxiety share some of the same symptoms, including rapid and unexpected changes in mood. Anxiety and depressive disorders can profoundly affect school attendance and schoolwork. Social withdrawal can exacerbate isolation and loneliness. Depression can lead to suicide. ","Depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents. Suicide  is the third leading cause of death among those aged 15–29 years old. ","One in six people are aged 10–19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood. Globally, it is estimated that one in seven (14%) of 10–19-year-olds experience mental health conditions (1), yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. ","Suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents and young adults (15–29 years) (2). Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, and include harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma against help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to means of suicide. Digital media, like any other media, can play a significant role in either enhancing or weakening suicide prevention efforts. Risk-taking behaviours ","The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults. Introduction "
Mental health of older adults,"Key facts By 2030, one in six people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. Loneliness and social isolation are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life. Overview ","For older adults, social connection is particularly important to reduce risk factors such as social isolation and loneliness. At this stage of life, meaningful social activities can significantly improve positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life; they can also reduce depressive symptoms. Example interventions include befriending initiatives, community and support groups, social skills training, creative arts groups, leisure and education services and volunteering programmes. Protection from ageism and abuse is also critical. Key interventions include anti-discrimination policies and laws, educational interventions and intergenerational activities. A range of carer interventions – including respite care, advice, education, financial support and psychological interventions – can support carers to maintain a good and healthy caring relationship that avoids abuse of older people. ","Some older adults are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, because of dire living conditions, poor physical health or lack of access to quality support and services. This includes older adults living in humanitarian settings and those living with chronic illnesses (such as heart disease, cancer or stroke), neurological conditions (such as dementia), or substance use problems. Promotion and prevention ","Mental health promotion and prevention strategies for older adults focus on supporting healthy ageing. That means creating physical and social environments that support well-being and enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. Key mental health promotion and prevention strategies for healthy ageing include: ","One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers. Approximately 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder. ","At older ages, mental health is shaped not only by physical and social environments but also by the cumulative impacts of earlier life experiences and specific stressors related to ageing. Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress. Older adults are more likely to experience adverse events such as bereavement, or a drop in income or reduced sense of purpose with retirement. Despite their many contributions to society, many older adults are subject to ageism, which can seriously affect people’s mental health. "
Mercury,"Key facts Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. Overview ","Signs and symptoms Mercury is toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury exists in various forms: elemental (or metallic); inorganic (e.g. mercuric chloride); and organic (e.g. methyl- and ethylmercury), which all have different toxic effects, including on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. ","Exposure to mercury – even small amounts – may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. ",Prevention and control Interventions to prevent environmental releases and human exposure include: ,"Switching to non-mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers in health care Mercury has been traditionally used in medical devices, especially thermometers and blood-pressure measurement devices. These represent a hazard in terms of both breakage and long-term disposal. Human exposure occurs mainly through inhalation of elemental mercury vapours. The exposure is entirely preventable with safe and effective mercury-free alternatives. ","It has been estimated that among selected subsistence fishing populations, between 1.5/1000 and 17/1000 children showed cognitive impacts caused by the consumption of fish containing mercury (1). Signs and symptoms "
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),"Approximately 35% of cases reported to WHO have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance systems. ","Symptoms The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but MERS patients may not always develop this condition. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation or support in an intensive care unit. Older people, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes appear to be at greater risk of developing severe disease. ","The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of pathogens that may cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments. Individuals at greater risk of developing severe disease should avoid contact with dromedary camels, drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. ","Prevention and treatment No vaccine or specific treatment are currently available, however several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in clinical development. In the absence of MERS-specific therapeutics, treatment of MERS patients is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition. ","Human-to-human transmission: Human-to-human transmission is possible and has occurred predominantly among close contacts and in health care settings. This includes family and household members, health care workers and other patients. The largest outbreaks have occurred in health care facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. Outside the health care setting, there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission documented anywhere in the world. Approximately 80% of human cases have been reported by Saudi Arabia, largely as a result of direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or infected individuals in health care facilities. Cases identified outside the Middle East are usually individuals who appear to have been infected in the Middle East and then travelled to areas outside the region. To date, a limited number of outbreaks have occurred outside the Middle East. ",
Migraine and other headache disorders,Key facts Headache disorders are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. Headache disorders ranked third (after stroke and dementia) in accounting for overall neurological disease burden as measured by age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019. Overview ,"Migraine is a primary headache disorder, in most cases episodic, that usually lasts 4–72 hours, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is sometimes preceded by a short lasting aura of unilateral, reversable visual, sensory or other symptoms. Migraine most often begins at puberty and generally affects those aged between 35 and 45 years. It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences. Children typically experience migraine of shorter duration and abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. ","Headache disorders, characterized by recurrent headaches, are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. A headache is a painful and disabling feature of primary headache disorders, namely migraine, tension-type headache and cluster headache. Headaches can also be caused by or occur secondarily to a long list of other conditions, the most common of which is medication-overuse headache. Headaches, particularly migraine, can also affect children and adolescents but can affect them in different ways. Children’s migraines often affect both sides of their head and are usually shorter in duration. But, similar to adults, migraines in childhood and adolescence can result in missing school, sports and other activities. Prevalence ","Many of those troubled by headaches do not receive effective diagnosis and care. Appropriate treatment of headache disorders requires training of health professionals, accurate diagnosis and recognition of the conditions, appropriate treatment with cost-effective medications, simple lifestyle modifications and patient education. The main classes of drugs to treat headache disorders include analgesics, anti-emetics, specific anti-migraine medications and prophylactic medications. For migraine treatment, analgesics need to be taken at the first sign of symptoms (such as visual aura) to prevent the associated headache. Simple interventions to educate people on medication overuse headaches, migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications are highly effective. Restricting or eliminating alcohol, regular sleep and exercise schedules, healthy diets, staying hydrated and using a headache calendar to identify other triggers are often all that is needed to provide relief. Barriers to effective care ","Worldwide, only a minority of people with headache disorders are appropriately diagnosed and treated by a health care provider. Headache has been underestimated, under-recognized and under-treated throughout the world. ","Migraines, tension-type headaches and medication-overuse headaches are of public health importance since they are responsible for high population levels of disability and ill health. Migraine "
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),"The MDGs have been superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are 8 goals that UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve by the year 2015. The United Nations Millennium Declaration, signed in September 2000, commits world leaders to combat poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and discrimination against women. The MDGs are derived from this Declaration. Each MDG has targets set for 2015 and indicators to monitor progress from 1990 levels. Several of these relate directly to health. ",,"Undernutrition which includes fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc, along with suboptimal breastfeeding; is the underlying cause of death in an estimated 45% of all deaths among children under 5 years of age. The proportion of underweight children in developing countries has declined from 28% to 17% between 1990 and 2013. This rate of progress is close to the rate required to meet the MDG target, however improvements have been unevenly distributed between and within different regions. Millennium Development Goal 4: reduce child mortality ","The coverage of interventions such as the distribution of insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying has greatly increased, and will need to be sustained in order to prevent the resurgence of disease and deaths caused by malaria. Globally, the MDG target of halting by 2015 and beginning to reverse the incidence of malaria has already been met. Tuberculosis ","To reduce the number of maternal deaths, women need access to good-quality reproductive health care and effective interventions. In 2012, 64% of women aged 15–49 years who were married or in a consensual union were using some form of contraception, while 12% wanted to stop or postpone childbearing but were not using contraception. The proportion of women receiving antenatal care at least once during pregnancy was about 83% for the period 2007–2014, but for the recommended minimum of 4 or more visits the corresponding figure drops to around 64%. ",
Mpox,Key facts ,"Common symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes. Mpox can be transmitted through close contact with someone who has mpox, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals. During pregnancy, the virus may be passed to the fetus, or to the newborn during or after birth. ","Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral illness caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb). In 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by the clade IIb strain. Mpox continues to be a threat today, and an upsurge of cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries caused by clades Ia and Ib has raised concern. ","Mpox is treated with supportive care for symptoms such as pain and fever, with close attention to nutrition, hydration, skin care, prevention of secondary infections and treatment of co-infections, including HIV where present. Overview ","People can also contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linen, through needle injuries in health care, or in community settings such as tattoo parlours. During pregnancy or birth, the virus may be passed to the baby. Contracting mpox during pregnancy can be dangerous for the fetus or newborn infant and can lead to loss of the pregnancy, stillbirth, death of the newborn, or complications for the parent.

Multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea,Key facts Overview ,,"Causes Resistance to so many treatment options, including penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides (including azithromycin), as well as so-called last line options like cephalosporins, make N. gonorrhoeae a multidrug resistant organism. ","WHO is implementing the Global Action Plan to Control the Spread and Impact of Antimicrobial Resistance in N. gonorrhoeae to facilitate effective actions against the spread of multi-drug resistant N. gonorrhoeae. This Plan is part of the greater STI surveillance plan to help early detection of emerging resistant strains, combined with a public health response to prevent and treat gonococcal infections and reduce the impact of gonorrhoea on sexual and reproductive health. The Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and STIs (2022–2030) has set targets to reduce the number of new cases of gonorrhoea among people 15–49 years old from 82.3 million per year in 2020 to 8.23 million per year in 2030, thus reducing the year incidence by 90% by 2030. Recognizing that this reduction may be difficult to achieve with available interventions, and given increasing antimicrobial resistance, the strategy has emphasized the need to develop effective gonococcal vaccines. No currently licensed gonococcal vaccines exist. However, interest in gonococcal vaccine development has been reinvigorated not only by the marked increases in gonococcal antimicrobial resistance, but also by mounting scientific evidence suggesting gonococcal vaccines are biologically feasible. ",Antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhoea has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced the options for treatment. Eighty-two million new cases of gonorrhoea occurred in 2020. ,"This suggests that reports of treatment failures and drug resistance in wealthier areas are only the tip of the global health burden. Surveillance data on antibiotic resistance and treatment failures from poorer countries are exceedingly scarce and need to be improved. Gonococcal resistance to ceftriaxone, the last remaining option for empiric first-line gonorrhoea treatment, is a major public health concern. Strains across the gonococcal species phylogeny have shown their capacity to develop ceftriaxone resistance. WHO’s Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP), found high levels of ceftriaxone resistance, mainly due to the spread of particularly resistant strains. This emphasizes the importance of gonococcal surveillance. Causes "
Multiple sclerosis,Overview Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that happens when the immune system attacks the brain and spinal cord. ,"Symptoms of MS vary from person to person and depend on the location and severity of nerve fibre damage. These often include vision problems, tiredness, trouble walking and keeping balance, and numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. Symptoms can come and go or last for a long time. The causes of MS are not known but a family history of the disease may increase the risk. ","Causes MS is an inflammatory demyelinating condition that results from an autoimmune attack on myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This disrupts the electrical impulses that are sent through the nerves to the rest of the body and results in scars (plaques or sclerosis). ","While there is no cure for MS, treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent further relapses and improve quality of life. MS can present in a variety of ways including: ",Treatment and care Treatments for MS will be different for each person. They depend on the stage of the disease and symptoms. ,
Musculoskeletal health,"Scope Musculoskeletal health refers to the performance of the locomotor system, comprising intact muscles, bones, joints and adjacent connective tissues. Musculoskeletal impairments comprise more than 150 different diseases/conditions that affect the system and are characterized by impairments in the muscles, bones, joints and adjacent connective tissues leading to temporary or lifelong limitations in functioning and participation. Musculoskeletal conditions are typically characterized by pain (often persistent) and limitations in mobility and dexterity, reducing people’s ability to work and participate in society. Pain experienced in musculoskeletal structures is the most common form of non-cancer pain. Musculoskeletal conditions are relevant across the life-course – from childhood to older age. They range from those conditions that arise suddenly and are short-lived (such as fractures, sprains and strains, associated with pain and limitations in functioning) though to long-term conditions such as chronic primary low back pain and osteoarthritis.

BMC Medicine 2018;16:167 ",,"While the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions increases with age, younger people are also affected, often during their peak income-earning years. For example, childhood auto-immune inflammatory conditions such as juvenile arthritis affect children’s development, while low back pain is the main reason for a premature exit from the workforce. The societal impact of early retirement in terms of direct health-care costs and indirect costs (i.e., work absenteeism or productivity loss) is enormous. Projections show that the number of people with low back pain will increase in the future, and even more rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries (3). Health estimates ","WHO launched the Rehabilitation 2030 initiative in 2017 to draw attention to the profound unmet need for rehabilitation worldwide, and to highlight the importance of strengthening rehabilitation in health systems. The initiative marks a new strategic approach for the global rehabilitation community by emphasizing that: Rehabilitation is an essential health service and crucial for achieving universal health coverage.

Mycetoma,"Mycetoma is a chronic disease usually of the foot but any part of the body can be affected. Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation of fungi or ‎bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue. So far more than 70 different bacteria and fungi have been indicated as causative agents. The disease commonly affects young adults, mostly males aged between 15 and 30 years in developing countries. People of low socioeconomic status and manual workers such as agriculturalists, labourers and herdsmen are the most commonly affected. ",,"Mycetoma is characterized by a combination of painless ‎subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge ‎containing grains. Within the grain, the causative agent is found. It usually ‎spreads to involve the skin, deep structures and bone, resulting in ‎destruction, ‎deformity and loss of function, which may be fatal. ‎Mycetoma commonly ‎involves the extremities, back and gluteal region but any other part of the body can be affected.‎ Given its slow progression, painless nature, lack of awareness, and scarcity of medical and health facilities in endemic areas, many patients present late with an advanced infection where amputation may be the only available treatment. Secondary bacterial infection is common, and that may cause increased pain, disability and fatal septicaemia (severe infections involving the entire human system), if untreated. Infection is not transmitted from human to human. Diagnosis ","Prevention & Control Mycetoma is not a notifiable disease (a disease required by law to be reported) and a global surveillance system is still being developed. There are no control programmes for mycetoma yet, except for Sudan. Preventing infection is difficult, but people living in or travelling to endemic areas should be advised not to walk barefooted. ","Mycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic impacts on patients, communities and health authorities. Accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available. However, early detection and treatment are important to reduce morbidity and improve treatment outcomes. Mycetoma was first reported in the mid-19th century in Madurai, India, and hence was initially called Madura foot. ",
Mycotoxins,"Overview Mycotoxins are toxic compounds that are naturally produced by certain types of moulds (fungi). Moulds that can produce mycotoxins grow on numerous foodstuffs such as cereals, dried fruits, nuts and spices. Mould growth can occur either before harvest or after harvest, during storage, on/in the food itself often under warm, damp and humid conditions. Most mycotoxins are chemically stable and survive food processing. Several hundred different mycotoxins have been identified, but the most commonly observed mycotoxins that present a concern to human health and livestock include aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, fumonisins, zearalenone and nivalenol/deoxynivalenol. Mycotoxins appear in the food chain as a result of  mould infection of crops both before and after harvest. Exposure to mycotoxins can happen either directly by eating infected food or indirectly from animals that are fed contaminated feed, in particular from milk. ","The effects of some food-borne mycotoxins are acute with symptoms of severe illness appearing quickly after consumption of food products contaminated with mycotoxins. Other mycotoxins occurring in food have been linked to long-term effects on health, including the induction of cancers and immune deficiency. Of the several hundred mycotoxins identified so far, about a dozen have gained the most attention due to their severe effects on human health and their occurrences in food. Aflatoxins are amongst the most poisonous mycotoxins and are produced by certain moulds (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. Crops that are frequently affected by Aspergillus spp. include cereals (corn, sorghum, wheat and rice), oilseeds (soybean, peanut, sunflower and cotton seeds), spices (chili peppers, black pepper, coriander, turmeric and ginger) and tree nuts (pistachio, almond, walnut, coconut and Brazil nut). The toxins can also be found in the milk of animals that are fed contaminated feed, in the form of aflatoxin M1. Large doses of aflatoxins can lead to acute poisoning (aflatoxicosis) and can be life threatening, usually through damage to the liver. Aflatoxins have also been shown to be genotoxic, meaning they can damage DNA and cause cancer in animal species. There is also evidence that they can cause liver cancer in humans. ","Ochratoxin A is produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium and is a common food-contaminating mycotoxin. Contamination of food commodities, such as cereals and cereal products, coffee beans, dry vine fruits, wine and grape juice, spices and liquorice, occurs worldwide. Ochratoxin A is formed during the storage of crops and is known to cause a number of toxic effects in animal species. The most sensitive and notable effect is kidney damage, but the toxin may also have effects on fetal development and on the immune system. Contrary to the clear evidence of kidney toxicity and kidney cancer due to ochratoxin A exposure in animals, this association in humans is unclear, however effects on kidney have been demonstrated. Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by a variety of moulds, particularly Aspergillus, Penicillium and  Byssochlamys. Often found in rotting  apples and apple products, patulin can also occur in various mouldy fruits, grains and other foods. Major human dietary sources of patulin are apples and apple juice made from affected fruit. The acute symptoms in animals include liver, spleen and kidney damage and toxicity to the immune system. For humans, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances and vomiting have been reported. Patulin is considered to be genotoxic however a carcinogenic potential has not been demonstrated yet. ","WHO, in collaboration with FAO, is responsible for assessing the risks to humans of mycotoxins – through contamination in food – and for recommending adequate protection. Risk assessments of mycotoxins in food done by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) are used by governments and by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the intergovernmental standards-setting body for food) to establish maximum levels in food or provide other risk management advice to control or prevent contamination. Codex standards are the international reference for national food supplies and for trade in food, so that people everywhere can be confident that the food they buy meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it was produced. ","JECFA or ad hoc FAO/WHO scientific expert groups consist of independent, international experts who conduct scientific reviews of all available studies and other relevant data on specific mycotoxins. The outcome of such health risk assessments can either be a maximum tolerable intake (exposure) level, or other guidance to indicate the level of health concern (such as the Margin of Exposure), including advice on risk management measures to prevent and control contamination, and on the analytical methods and monitoring and control activities. These tolerable daily intakes are used by governments and international risk managers, such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum levels for mycotoxins in food. The maximum levels for mycotoxins in food are very low due to their severe toxicity. For example, the maximum levels for aflatoxins set by the Codex in various nuts, grains, dried figs and milk are in the range of 0.5 to 15 µg/kg (a µg is one billionth of a kilogram). The Codex maximum limit for patulin in apple juice is 50 µg/L. ","Exposure to mycotoxins needs to be kept as low as possible to protect the people. Mycotoxins not only pose a risk to both human and animal health, but also impact food security and nutrition by reducing people’s access to healthy food. WHO encourages national authorities to monitor and ensure that levels of mycotoxins in foodstuff on their market are as low as possible and comply with the both national and international maximum levels, conditions and legislation. "
Natural toxins in food,"What are natural toxins? Natural toxins are toxic compounds that are naturally produced by living organisms. These toxins are not harmful to the organisms themselves but they may be toxic to other creatures, including humans, when eaten. These chemical compounds have diverse structures and differ in biological function and toxicity. ","Another example is ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) which is caused by consuming fish contaminated with dinoflagellates that produce ciguatoxins. Some fish known to harbour ciguatoxins include barracuda, black grouper, dog snapper, and king mackerel. Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling sensation on fingers and toes. There is currently no specific treatment for ciguatera poisoning. Cyanogenic glycosides ","Toxins formed by algae in the ocean and fresh water are called algal toxins. Algal toxins are generated during blooms of particular naturally occurring algal species. Shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters are more likely to contain these toxins than fish. Algal toxins can cause diarrhea, vomiting, tingling, paralysis and other effects in humans, other mammals or fish. The algal toxins can be retained in shellfish and fish or contaminate drinking water. They have no taste or smell, and are not eliminated by cooking or freezing. Another example is ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) which is caused by consuming fish contaminated with dinoflagellates that produce ciguatoxins. Some fish known to harbour ciguatoxins include barracuda, black grouper, dog snapper, and king mackerel. Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling sensation on fingers and toes. There is currently no specific treatment for ciguatera poisoning. ","PAs are stable during processing, and have been detected in herbal teas, honey, herbs and spices and other food products, such as cereals and cereal products.  Human exposure is estimated to be low, however. Due to the complexity of the subject and the large number of related compounds, the overall health risk has not been fully evaluated yet. Guidance is under development by the FAO/WHO Codex Committee on Contaminants in Food on management strategies to prevent PA-containing plants from entering the food chain. How can I minimize the health risk from natural toxins? ","Many types of beans contain toxins called lectins, and kidney beans have the highest concentrations – especially red kidney beans. As few as 4 or 5 raw beans can cause severe stomachache, vomiting and diarrhoea. Lectins are destroyed when the dried beans are soaked for at least 12 hours and then boiled vigorously for at least 10 minutes in water. Tinned kidney beans have already had this process applied and so can be used without further treatment. Mycotoxins ","Some toxins are produced by plants as a natural defense mechanism against predators, insects or microorganisms, or as consequence of infestation with microorganisms, such as mould, in response to climate stress (such as drought or extreme humidity). Other sources of natural toxins are microscopic algae and plankton in oceans or sometimes in lakes that produce chemical compounds that are toxic to humans but not to fish or shellfish that eat these toxin-producing organisms. When people eat fish or shellfish that contain these toxins, illness can rapidly follow. "
Newborn mortality,"Key facts The first month of life is the most vulnerable period for child survival, with 2.3 million newborns dying in 2022. Overview ",,"Premature birth, birth complications (birth asphyxia/trauma), neonatal infections and congenital anomalies remain the leading causes of neonatal deaths. Children who die within the first 28 days of birth suffer from conditions and diseases associated with lack of quality care at birth or skilled care and treatment immediately after birth and in the first days of life. ","The vast majority of newborn deaths take place in low and middle-income countries. Plans to improve newborn survival should be built on a strong foundation of essential newborn care and align with the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) and Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM) targets on antenatal care, postnatal care, skilled health personnel and emergency obstetric and newborn care. Increasing financing and allocating resources towards two very high-impact but high-cost interventions – care for small and sick newborns and emergency obstetric care – are critical, as these measures provide quadruple returns on investment by reducing maternal deaths, stillbirths, newborn deaths and both maternal and newborn morbidity. In settings with well-functioning midwife programmes, the provision of midwife-led continuity of care (MLCC) can reduce preterm births by up to 24%. MLCC is a model of care in which a midwife or a team of midwives provide care to the same woman throughout her pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period, calling upon medical support if necessary. With the increase in facility births (almost 80% globally), there is a great opportunity for providing essential newborn care and identifying and managing high risk newborns. However, few women and newborns stay in the facility for the recommended 24 hours after birth, which is the most critical time when complications can present. In addition, too many newborns die at home because of early discharge from the hospital, barriers to access and delays in seeking care. The four recommended postnatal care contacts delivered at health facility or through home visits play a key role to reach these newborns and their families. ","Neonatal deaths have decreased by 44% since 2000. Yet in 2022, nearly half (47%) of all deaths in children under 5 years of age occurred in the newborn period (the first 28 days of life), which is among the most vulnerable periods of life and requires intensified quality intrapartum and newborn care. In 2022, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 57% (2.8 (2.5–3.3) million) of total under-5 deaths but only 30% of global live births. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world at 27 deaths per 1000 live births, followed by central and southern Asia, with a neonatal mortality rate of 21 deaths per 1000 live births.

Nipah virus,Overview ,"Signs and symptoms Human infections range from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection (mild, severe), and fatal encephalitis. ","Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus (it is transmitted from animals to humans) and can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people. In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can also cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers. Although Nipah virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern. ","During the first recognized outbreak in Malaysia, which also affected Singapore, most human infections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated tissues. Transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to secretions from the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick animal. In subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection. ","Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers of infected patients. During the later outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, Nipah virus spread directly from human-to-human through close contact with people's secretions and excretions. In Siliguri, India in 2001, transmission of the virus was also reported within a health-care setting, where 75% of cases occurred among hospital staff or visitors. From 2001 to 2008, around half of reported cases in Bangladesh were due to human-to-human transmission through providing care to infected patients. ","Most people who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but long term neurologic conditions have been reported in survivors.  Approximately 20% of patients are left with residual neurological consequences such as seizure disorder and personality changes. A small number of people who recover subsequently relapse or develop delayed onset encephalitis. The case fatality rate is estimated at 40% to 75%. This rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. "
Noma,"Key facts Noma is a severe gangrenous disease of the mouth and face. Its pathogenesis is linked with non-specific polymicrobial organisms and a range of modifiable risk factors and underlying social determinants shared with other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Noma mainly affects children aged 2−6 years old and is found most commonly among those living in poor communities. Africa is the most affected continent, although cases have also been reported in Asia, the Americas and other regions. 1. Srour, M. L., Marck, K., & Baratti-Mayer, D. Noma: Overview of a Neglected Disease and Human Rights Violation. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 2017, 96(2), 268–274. ",,"Limitations exist in our current understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of noma. Evidence indicates that the causative agents of noma are non-specific polymicrobial organisms. There is also a wide range of associated risk factors reported: research highlights that the disease is linked with malnutrition, other causes of immunosuppression, underlying infections, poor oral health and extreme poverty. Noma is considered an opportunistic and non-contagious disease: there is no documented evidence to support direct transmission from person to person. Diagnosis ","After the inception of WHO's programme to control noma in 1994, the WHO Oral Health Programme has led global and regional noma control efforts including the implementation of the Regional Noma Control Programme in eleven priority countries in the WHO African Region. This programme focuses on strengthening and developing the capacities of health workers, social actors and communities to prevent, promptly detect and manage cases of noma. Improved awareness of the disease among populations and mental health counselling helps to remove stigma and enhances the reintegration of noma survivors and their families into society. Integration of noma into existing health surveillance systems can improve data availability and accessibility and strengthen the leadership of ministries of health through improved inter- and multisectoral collaboration. Moreover, WHO has encouraged Member States to take a more integrated approach to preventing and controlling noma, caused by a range of modifiable risk factors, and their underlying social determinants shared with NTDs. ","The latest WHO estimates on burden of disease date to 1998, with an estimated 140 000 incident cases per year and a prevalence of 770 000 cases. The case-fatality rate was estimated at 90%, although evidence shows that this can be greatly reduced by early treatment. Accurate estimations of noma’s burden are challenging, as many cases go undiagnosed, untreated and unreported due to the fast progression of the disease, high case-fatality rate, weak health systems including surveillance, associated stigma and lack of awareness of noma by healthcare workers and caregivers. ","Affected children that survive the diseases are often left with serious aesthetic and functional consequences including disfigurement and impairments in breathing, swallowing, speaking and vision that further contribute to their social isolation, stigmatization, discrimination, and consequently to violations of their human rights. Overview "
Noncommunicable diseases,"Key facts Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) killed at least 43 million people in 2021, equivalent to 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths globally. In 2021, 18 million people died from an NCD before age 70 years; 82% of these premature deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. ",,"Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or at least 19 million deaths in 2021, followed by cancers (10 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (over 2 million including kidney disease deaths caused by diabetes). These four groups of diseases account for 80% of all premature NCD deaths. ",Prevention and control An important way to control NCDs is to focus on reducing the risk factors associated with these diseases. Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities. ,"Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs. Overview ","Socioeconomic impact NCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target of reducing the probability of death from any of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 years by one third by 2030. "
Nursing and midwifery,"Key facts There are an estimated 29 million nurses worldwide and 2.2 million midwives. WHO estimates a shortage of 4.5 million nurses and 0.31 million midwives by the year 2030 (1). That will bring the a global shortage of health workers estimated for 2030 to 4.8 million nurses and midwives, with the greatest gaps found in countries in Africa, South-East Asia and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as well as some parts of Latin America (1). Overview ",,,"and includes between two and four policy priorities If enacted and sustained, these policy priorities can support advancement along the four strategic directions: 1) educating enough midwives and nurses with competencies to meet population health needs; 2) creating jobs, managing migration, and recruiting and retaining midwives and nurses where they are most needed; 3) strengthening nursing and midwifery leadership throughout health and academic systems; and 4) ensuring midwives and nurses are supported, respected, protected, motivated and equipped to safely and optimally contribute in their service delivery settings. WHO engages ministries of health, the Government Chief Nurses and Midwives (GCNMOs) and other relevant stakeholders to enable effective planning, coordination and management of nursing and midwifery programmes in countries. The Global Forum for the Government Chief Nurses and Midwives, established in 2004, is organized by WHO and meets every two years. It is a Forum for senior nursing and midwifery officials to develop and inform areas of shared interest. WHO also engages with academic institutions specialised in nursing and midwifery. Forty-seven academic centres are designated as Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery with WHO. The academic centres are affiliated to the Global Network of WHO Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery. ","Nurses and midwives play a pivotal role in improving health and contributing to the wider economy. Investing in them is imperative to achieve efficient, effective, resilient and sustainable health systems. They not only provide essential care but also play a critical role in shaping health policies and driving primary health care. Nurses and midwives deliver care in emergency settings and safeguard the sustainability of health systems globally. Globally, 67% of the health and social workforce are women compared to 41% in all employment sectors. Nursing and midwifery occupations represent a significant share of the female workforce. ",
Obesity and overweight,"Key facts In 2022, 1 in 8 people in the world were living with obesity. Worldwide adult obesity has more than doubled since 1990, and adolescent obesity has quadrupled. Overview ",,Causes of overweight and obesity Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance of energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical activity). ,"Prevention and management Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable and manageable. ","when a diagnosis of obesity is established, provide integrated obesity prevention and management health services including on healthy diet, physical activity and medical and surgical measures; and monitor other NCD risk factors (blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure) and assess the presence of comorbidities and disability, including mental health disorders. ",Common health consequences The health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood. 
Occupational health: health workers,Overview ,,"Safeguarding the health, safety and well-being of health workers can prevent diseases and injuries caused by work, while improving the quality and safety of care, human resources for health and environmental sustainability in the health sector. Safeguarding the health, safety and well-being of health workers ","The protection of health and safety of health workers should be part of the core business of the health sector: to protect and restore health without causing harm to patients and workers. Safeguarding the health, safety and well-being of health workers can prevent diseases and injuries caused by work, while improving the quality and safety of care, human resources for health and environmental sustainability in the health sector. ","Health workers are all people engaged in work actions whose primary intent is to improve health, including doctors, nurses, midwives, public health professionals, laboratory technicians, health technicians, medical and non-medical technicians, personal care workers, community health workers, healers and traditional medicine practitioners. The term also includes health management and support workers such as cleaners, drivers, hospital administrators, district health managers and social workers, and other occupational groups in health-related activities as defined by the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08). Health workers are the backbone of any functioning health system. While contributing to the enjoyment of the right to health for all, health workers should also enjoy the right to healthy and safe working conditions to maintain their own health. ","Health workers have the right to remove themselves from a work situation that they have reasonable justification to believe presents an imminent and serious danger to their lives or health. When a staff member exercises this right, he or she shall be protected from any undue consequences. WHO response "
Older children and young adolescent mortality (5 to 14 years),"Overview Globally, mortality falls from the peak at under 5, to a low in 10–­­14year-olds, then increases again for older adolescents and young adults. While the level of mortality differs considerably between regions, this age pattern is generally consistent across regions except for Australia and New Zealand, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean, which see the lowest mortality among those aged 5–9 years. However, survival chances for older children and young adolescents vary greatly across the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, the probability of dying among those aged 5–14 years in 2020 was 26 deaths per 1000 children aged 5 years. Approximately 77% of deaths among those aged 5–14 years occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South- East Asia, up from 72% in 1990. The average global probability of a 5-year-old dying before their 14th birthday was 8 times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in the WHO Region of the Americas. ",,"What are the leading causes of death? While preterm birth, birth trauma and infectious diseases cause the most deaths in children under 5 years, injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning) rank among the top causes of death and lifelong disability among older children and young adolescents aged 5–14 years. The patterns of death in those aged 5 to 14 years reflect the underlying risk profiles of the age groups, with a shift away from infectious diseases of childhood and towards accidents and injuries. Sex differences in mortality rates become apparent starting in adolescence, with males having higher mortality rates than females. ","The rise of injury deaths changes the nature of interventions to improve survival for those aged 5 to 14 years. There is a shift from health sector actions to prevent and treat the infectious diseases of early childhood towards other government sectors including education, transportation and road infrastructure, water and sanitation and law enforcement.  These sectors need to work together to prevent premature mortality in older children and young adolescents. COVID-19 disease and children aged 5 to 14 years ","Data from civil registration and vital statistic systems (CRVS), health management information systems (HMIS) from 80 countries as well as specific country-wide monitoring systems (Mozambique and South Africa) indicate no significant deviation from expected mortality for 2020 in this age group and in some cases indicate fewer deaths than would be expected from historical data. As more data comes in from countries, and further analyses are performed, these results may change for 2021. WHO response ",
Onchocerciasis,Key facts ,"Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. The disease primarily affects rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and Yemen, with smaller endemic areas foci found in parts of Latin America. ","Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. The parasite is spread and transmitted to humans by the repeated bites of infected blackflies that breed in rapidly flowing rivers. ","More than 99% of infected people live in Africa and Yemen; the remaining 1% live on the border between Brazil and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). In 2023 at least 249.5 million people required preventive treatment against onchocerciasis. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated in 2017 that 14.6 million of the infected people already had skin disease and 1.15 million had vision loss. Five countries have been verified by WHO as free of onchocerciasis after successfully implementing elimination activities for decades: four in the region of the Americas: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Mexico (2015) and Guatemala (2016), and one in Africa: Niger (2025) ","Population-based treatment with ivermectin (also known as mass drug administration or MDA) is the current core strategy to eliminate onchocerciasis, with a minimum requirement of 80% therapeutic coverage. Ivermectin is donated by Merck under the brand name of Mectizan®. Overview ",

Opioid overdose,Key facts The term “opioids” includes compounds that are extracted from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum) as well as semisynthetic and synthetic compounds with similar properties that can interact with opioid receptors in the brain. ,"Their regular non-medical use, prolonged use, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems. Opioid dependence is a disorder of regulation of opioid use arising from repeated or continuous use of opioids. The characteristic feature of dependence is a strong internal drive to use opioids, which manifests itself by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including increased tolerance to the effects of opioids, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use, or repeated use of opioids or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms (1). Worldwide, about 296 million people (or 5.8% of the global population aged 15–64 years) used drugs at least once in 2021. Among them, about 60 million people used opioids. About 39.5 million people lived with drug use disorders in 2021(2). Most people dependent on opioids used illicitly cultivated and manufactured heroin, but the proportion of those using prescription opioids is growing. ","Due to their pharmacological effects, opioids can cause breathing difficulties, and opioid overdose can lead to death. Worldwide, in 2019 about 600 000 deaths were attributable to drug use. Close to 80% of these deaths are related to opioids, with about 25% of those deaths caused by opioid overdose. ",The medication naloxone can prevent death from an opioid overdose if administered in time. Opioids ,"Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of pain, and include medicines such as morphine, fentanyl and tramadol. Their non-medical use, prolonged use, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems. ",
Oral health,Key facts ,,"Oral diseases are caused by a range of modifiable risk factors common to many noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including sugar consumption, tobacco use, alcohol use and poor hygiene, and their underlying social and commercial determinants. Overview ","Oral diseases, while largely preventable, pose a major health burden for many countries and affect people throughout their lifetime, causing pain, discomfort, disfigurement and even death. It is estimated that oral diseases affect nearly 3.7 billion people. ",Prevention and treatment for oral health conditions is expensive and usually not part of national universal health coverage (UHC) benefit packages. Most low- and middle-income countries do not have sufficient services available to prevent and treat oral health conditions. ,"Most oral health conditions are largely preventable and can be treated in their early stages. Most cases are dental caries (tooth decay), periodontal diseases, tooth loss and oral cancers. Other oral conditions of public health importance are orofacial clefts, noma (severe gangrenous disease starting in the mouth mostly affecting children) and oro-dental trauma. Prevalence of the main oral diseases continues to increase globally with growing urbanization and changes in living conditions. This is primarily due to inadequate exposure to fluoride (in the water supply and oral hygiene products such as toothpaste), availability and affordability of food with high sugar content and poor access to oral health care services in the community. Marketing of food and beverages high in sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol, have led to a growing consumption of products that contribute to oral health conditions and other NCDs. "
Oropouche virus disease,Key facts ,"Symptoms of Oropouche virus disease are similar to those that occur in other diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, and the cause of infection is often misdiagnosed. In 2024 concerns arose about possible complications of Oropouche virus infection including two deaths in previously healthy infected adults, and of possible negative outcomes of infection during pregnancy with associated fetal death, miscarriage, and microcephaly in newborns, that requires further investigation and research. ","Oropouche virus disease (also known as Oropouche fever) is a febrile illness, from which patients typically recover quickly, that is caused by the Oropouche virus, which is spread to humans through the bites of infected biting midges, and possibly of some mosquitoes. The Oropouche virus is present mostly in South America and the Caribbean, but since December 2023 more cases were reported, totalling over 10 000 cases in 2024, including from areas in the region where it was not previously detected. ","Infections can be prevented mainly through vector control and personal protective measures against insect bites, including use of meshed bed nets, chemical insecticides, protective clothing, and insect repellents is recommended. Overview ","No specific treatments or vaccines are available for Oropouche virus disease, and patients should receive supportive care. Infections can be prevented mainly through vector control and personal protective measures against insect bites, including use of meshed bed nets, chemical insecticides, protective clothing, and insect repellents is recommended.

Osteoarthritis,Overview ,"Exercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility. Once pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress. ","Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness, affecting a person’s ability to move freely. Osteoarthritis affects the entire joint, including the tissues around it. It is most common in the knees, hips, spine and hands. ","Prevention and control Several key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent osteoarthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing overuse of joints (e.g. related to workload), and promoting healthy lifestyles (e.g. regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight) play an important role. ","Treatment and management Management of osteoarthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person’s needs and preferences. ","As a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected. "
Palliative care,,Addressing suffering involves taking care of issues beyond physical symptoms. Palliative care uses a team approach to support patients and their caregivers. This includes addressing practical needs and providing bereavement counselling. It offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death. Palliative care is explicitly recognized under the human right to health. It should be provided through person-centered and integrated health services that pay special attention to the specific needs and preferences of individuals. ,,"Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients (adults and children) and their families who are facing problems associated with life-threatening illness. It prevents and relieves suffering through the early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, whether physical, psychosocial or spiritual. Addressing suffering involves taking care of issues beyond physical symptoms. Palliative care uses a team approach to support patients and their caregivers. This includes addressing practical needs and providing bereavement counselling. It offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death. ","Palliative care is required for a wide range of diseases. The majority of adults in need of palliative care have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (38.5%), cancer (34%), chronic respiratory diseases (10.3%), AIDS (5.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). Many other conditions may require palliative care, including kidney failure, chronic liver disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, congenital anomalies and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Pain and difficulty in breathing are two of the most frequent and serious symptoms experienced by patients in need of palliative care. For example, 80% of patients with AIDS or cancer, and 67% of patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will experience moderate to severe pain at the end of their lives. Opioids are essential for managing pain.

Parkinson disease,Overview ,"PD gets worse over time. There is no cure, but therapies and medicines can reduce symptoms. Common symptoms include tremors, painful muscle contractions and difficulty speaking. Parkinson disease results in high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia. ","Parkinson disease (PD) is a brain condition that causes problems with movement, mental health, sleep, pain and other health issues. PD gets worse over time. There is no cure, but therapies and medicines can reduce symptoms. Common symptoms include tremors, painful muscle contractions and difficulty speaking. ","People with PD require accessible health services for general healthcare needs like the rest of the population, including medicine access, promotive and preventive services and prompt diagnosis, treatment and care. A common barrier is created by healthcare providers’ inadequate knowledge and understanding of PD and myths that PD is a contagious illness or a normal part of aging. WHO response ","Involuntary movements (dyskinesias) and painful muscle contractions (dystonias) can cause problems speaking and moving. These symptoms lead to high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia during the course of their disease. While PD is the most common movement disorder, other movement disorders exist such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, chorea, ataxia and dystonia. Some movement disorders have similar symptoms to PD such as tremor, slow movement and rigidity. All movement disorders share the same challenges as PD regarding diagnostic and treatment gaps and access to medication, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). ","Impact on families and carers Informal carers (i.e. most commonly family members and friends) spend many hours daily providing care for people living with PD. This can be overwhelming. Physical, emotional and financial pressures can cause great stress to families and carers, and support is required from the health, social, financial and legal systems. Useful support resources from other conditions can be drawn upon, such as WHO’s iSupport programme for dementia. "
Patient safety,Overview ,,"Sepsis. Sepsis is a serious condition that happens when the body’s immune system has an extreme response to an infection. The body’s reaction causes damage to its own tissues and organs. Of all sepsis cases managed in hospitals, 23.6% were found to be health care associated, and approximately 24.4% of affected patients lost their lives as a result (9). Diagnostic errors. These occur in 5–20% of physician–patient encounters (10,11). According to doctor reviews, harmful diagnostic errors were found in a minimum of 0.7% of adult admissions (12). Most people will suffer a diagnostic error in their lifetime (13). ","Patient safety is defined as “the absence of preventable harm to a patient and reduction of risk of unnecessary harm associated with health care to an acceptable minimum."" Within the broader health system context, it is “a framework of organized activities that creates cultures, processes, procedures, behaviours, technologies and environments in health care that consistently and sustainably lower risks, reduce the occurrence of avoidable harm, make error less likely and reduce impact of harm when it does occur."" Common sources of patient harm ","“First, do no harm” is the most fundamental principle of any health care service. No one should be harmed in health care; however, there is compelling evidence of a huge burden of avoidable patient harm globally across the developed and developing health care systems. This has major human, moral, ethical and financial implications. Patient safety is defined as “the absence of preventable harm to a patient and reduction of risk of unnecessary harm associated with health care to an acceptable minimum."" Within the broader health system context, it is “a framework of organized activities that creates cultures, processes, procedures, behaviours, technologies and environments in health care that consistently and sustainably lower risks, reduce the occurrence of avoidable harm, make error less likely and reduce impact of harm when it does occur."" ","Pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers are injuries to the skin or soft tissue. They develop from pressure to particular parts of the body over an extended period. If not promptly managed, they can have fatal complications. Pressure ulcers affect more than 1 in 10 adult patients admitted to hospitals (18) and, despite being highly preventable, they have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals, and their quality of life. Unsafe transfusion practices. Unnecessary transfusions and unsafe transfusion practices expose patients to the risk of serious adverse transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmissible infections. Data on adverse transfusion reactions from a group of 62 countries show an average incidence of 12.2 serious reactions per 100 000 distributed blood components. "
Pesticide residues in food,"Overview There are more than 1000 pesticides used around the world to ensure food is not damaged or destroyed by pests. Each pesticide has different properties and toxicological effects. Many of the older, less costly (off-patent) pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil and water. These chemicals have been banned by countries which signed the 2001 Stockholm Convention, an international treaty that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants. ",,"None of the pesticides currently authorized for use on food in international trade are genotoxic (damaging to DNA, which can cause mutations or cancer). Adverse effects from these pesticides occur only above a certain safe level of exposure. When people come into contact with large quantities of pesticide, the result may be acute poisoning or long-term health effects that may include cancer and adverse effects on reproduction. Scope of the problem ",to protect public health by setting maximum limits for pesticide residues in food and water. Who is at risk? ,"WHO and FAO have jointly developed the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management. The most recent edition of this voluntary framework was published in 2014. It guides government regulators, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders on best practices in managing pesticides throughout their lifecycle, from production to disposal. ",Global impact The United Nations Population Division estimates that by the year 2050 there will be 9.7 billion people on Earth – around 30% more people than in 2017. Nearly all of this population growth will occur in developing countries. 
Physical activity,Key facts Regular physical activity provides significant physical and mental health benefits. ,"In adults, physical activity contributes to prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes and reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, enhances brain health, and can improve overall well-being. In children and adolescents, physical activity promotes bone health, encourages healthy growth and development of muscle, and improves motor and cognitive development. ","in adults and older adults, reduced risk of all-cause mortality, risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, incident hypertension, incident site-specific cancers, incident type-2 diabetes, and falls and improved mental health, cognitive health, sleep and measures of body fat; and for pregnant and post-partum women, decreased risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, excessive gestational weight gain, delivery complications, postpartum depression and newborn complications. Physical activity has no adverse effects on birthweight or increased risk of stillbirth. ",,The global estimate of the cost of physical inactivity to public health care systems between 2020 and 2030 is about US$ 300 billion (approximately US$ 27 billion per year) if levels of physical inactivity are not reduced. Overview ,"conducting advocacy to raise awareness of the multiple benefits of increasing physical activity and support the development of economic analysis of the impact of increasing physical activity and return on investment of different policy interventions; developing technical tools and training packages to help countries build capacity in the implementation of policy and programmes across key settings and innovations using digital platforms including through WHO Academy courses, multi-country workshops and other knowledge exchange activities; "
Plague,,"Signs and symptoms People infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and weakness, vomiting and nausea. ","Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through: the bite of infected vector fleas ",unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague. ,"Treatment Untreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time. Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated, but common antibiotics for enterobacteria (gram negative rods) can effectively cure the disease if they are delivered early. ",
Pneumonia in children,"Overview Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. ","The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions. ","Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5 years. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but deaths are highest in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and it can be treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care. Causes ","Pneumonia can be spread in several ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention. Presenting features ","Treatment Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice for first line treatment is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia. ",
Podoconiosis (non-filarial lymphoedema),Overview ,Signs and symptoms The early symptoms of podoconiosis include a burning sensation and itching on the back of the feet. Skin thickening is accompanied by papillomatous growths around the sides of the feet and the heel. Reversible foot and lower leg oedema (swelling) later becomes fixed and gradually progresses up the leg. Swelling is bilateral but often asymmetrical and the swelling is mostly limited to below the knees. Nodules and maceration between toes are common. ,"Podoconiosis is a non-infectious geochemical leg swelling (lymphoedema) caused by long-term exposure of bare feet to irritant soils. It is responsible for an estimated 4 million cases of lymphoedema in highland tropical and sub-tropical areas of 17 countries in Africa, Central and South America and South and South-East Asia. Podoconiosis affects poor, remote, subsistence farming communities and, by affecting livelihoods, it traps these communities in poverty. Women and girls are both more likely to contract podoconiosis and more likely to suffer from its social and economic consequences. ","Interventions include prevention of contact with the soil through consistent wearing of shoes from an early age and daily foot washing. Treatment using a holistic lymphoedema management package has been demonstrated to decrease swelling, disability and incidence of acute attacks, improve quality of life, and can be readily mainstreamed into government community health services. Scope of the problem ","Treatment and care Treatment of podoconiosis is currently based on lymphoedema management (foot hygiene, compression, exercises and elevation), psychosocial and mental health support, and use of shoes to reduce exposure to irritant soil. Surgical removal of large nodules can be achieved with satisfactory healing rates, allowing patients to use custom designed shoes. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a holistic physical and mental health care package for people with lymphoedema caused by lymphatic filariasis, leprosy or podoconiosis (mainstreamed into routine primary health care services in Ethiopia) has been demonstrated. Expert patients (patients who have been trained to successfully manage their condition and assist others in doing so) can be trained to guide treatment for uncomplicated lymphoedema. ","Global impact Until recently, podoconiosis was assumed to lead to illness rather than deaths. However, the death rate among people with podoconiosis is greater than that of a comparison cohort in a similar setting, with an overall standardized mortality rate of 6. Podoconiosis also has severe social and economic consequences. Patients lose 45% of their economically productive time because of morbidity associated with the disease. In Ethiopia alone, it is estimated that podoconiosis causes 172 073 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to be lost annually. Most of these DALYs are due to chronic lymphoedema, and only 2.6% are attributable to ADLA episodes. Podoconiosis is considered the most stigmatizing health problem in endemic areas. Patients have almost 7 times the risk of lower-than-average quality of life scores and 11 times the likelihood of depression than healthy neighbours. "
Poliomyelitis,"Key facts Polio (poliomyelitis) mainly affects children under 5 years of age. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5–10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. Overview ","Symptoms and risk Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those paralysed, 5–10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. ",,"There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. There are two vaccines available: oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine. Both are effective and safe, and both are used in different combinations worldwide, depending on local epidemiological and programmatic circumstances, to ensure the best possible protection to populations can be provided.

Polycystic ovary syndrome,Key facts Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects an estimated 6–13% of reproductive-aged women. Up to 70% of affected women remain undiagnosed worldwide. Overview ,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time. PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility. ",PCOS is the commonest cause of anovulation and a leading cause of infertility. PCOS is associated with a variety of long-term health problems that affect physical and emotional well-being. ,"WHO works with Member States and partners to address PCOS as part of its efforts to improve women’s health and reproductive well-being globally. WHO works with governmental and non-governmental partners to enhance public awareness related to PCOS, and to generate guidance to healthcare providers on how it can be identified and treated. In addition, WHO promotes research related to the most effective ways of preventing, diagnosing and treating infertility due to PCOS, and identifies the most important unanswered questions related to it. WHO supports the generation of statistics on how common infertility and its causes (such as PCOS) are. WHO helps member states to pay more attention to infertility and its causes within national health policies, services and financing to ensure that everyone who needs healthcare related to infertility is able to obtain it without financial hardship. ","PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments. The cause of PCOS is unknown but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk. ",
Post COVID-19 condition (long COVID),"Key facts Most patients with COVID-19 recover fully, but some develop post COVID-19 condition with medium- to long-term effects on one or more body systems. Approximately 6 in every 100 people who have COVID-19 develop post COVID-19 condition. ","Fatigue, breathlessness, muscle or joint pain, and impaired sleep are common symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition. WHO is working to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of post COVID-19 condition. ","More recent research shows the chances of developing post COVID-19 condition have reduced, but these data are limited and mostly from high-income countries (3). However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19 is widely circulating and post COVID-19 condition remains a substantial threat and ongoing challenge to global public health. Risk factors ","Prevention People can be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 multiple times. Each time, they have a risk of developing post COVID-19 condition. Therefore, risk reduction with preventive measures such as the use of masks, personal hygiene and ventilation in high-risk situations continues to be important. Receiving two doses of vaccination appears to reduce the likelihood chance of developing post COVID-19 condition (9). ",Health-care providers can guide patients on self-management of symptoms and offer medication for symptom relief or referral for rehabilitation services as needed. Overview ,"Impact Post COVID-19 condition can affect the ability to work and may lead to loss of productivity, and a reduction in income and quality of life. Ongoing medical needs of people with the condition may stretch existing health systems. "
Post-traumatic stress disorder,Key facts An estimated 3.9% of the world population has had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some stage in their lives. Most people exposed to potentially traumatic events do not develop PTSD. ,"Symptoms and patterns Experiencing distress or other mental health difficulties after a potentially traumatic event is common but does not mean someone is experiencing PTSD. Someone experiences PTSD when they have symptoms re-experiencing the event, avoid reminders of the event and experience symptoms of heightened arousal that cause significant distress, and interfere with daily activities and family, social, school or working life. ","Symptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms. People with PTSD may also have depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Many of the effects of PTSD (such as physical tension or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for physical diseases such as cardiovascular disease. ",,There are effective treatments for PTSD. Overview ,
Pre-eclampsia,Key Facts Pre-eclampsia affects 2–8% of pregnancies worldwide. There are around 46 000 maternal deaths due to pre-eclampsia per year and around 500 000 fetal or newborn deaths (1). Overview ,"Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed based on the onset of hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (≥0.3 g/24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Severe pre-eclampsia may include symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances and upper abdominal pain. Risk factors ",Global and regional causes of maternal deaths 2009–20: a WHO systematic analysis. Lancet Glob Health. 2025. ,"Pre-eclampsia is a high blood pressure disorder that typically develops after 20 weeks into pregnancy. It can present serious risks to both mother and baby. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia, which involves seizures. Both conditions can be life-threatening. Diagnosis ","Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. Understanding these risk factors is essential for proactive monitoring and management. Having a risk factor doesn't always mean pre-eclampsia will occur, but closer medical supervision beyond routine screening is recommended. Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, including: ",
Prequalification of medicines by WHO,"WHO prequalification of medicines is a service provided by WHO to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. Originally, in 2001, the focus was on medicines for treating HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. In 2006, this was extended to cover medicines and products for reproductive health and again in 2008, to cover prequalification of zinc, for managing acute diarrhoea in children. At the end of 2012, the WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products contained 316 medicines for priority diseases. Every year, billions of US dollars worth of medicines are purchased by international procurement agencies for distribution in resource-limited countries. Prequalification is intended to give these agencies the choice of a wide range of quality medicines for bulk purchase. ",,,,it is recommended for use by a current WHO treatment guideline. 2.

Preterm birth,"Overview Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. There are sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age: extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks) ",,"Babies may be born preterm because of spontaneous preterm labour or because there is a medical indication to plan an induction of labour or caesarean birth early. An estimated 13.4 million babies were born too early in 2020. That is more than 1 in 10 babies. Approximately 900 000 children die in 2019 of complications of preterm birth (1). Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. ","Preventing deaths and complications from preterm birth starts with a healthy pregnancy. WHO’s antenatal care guidelines include key interventions to help prevent preterm birth, such as counselling on healthy diet, optimal nutrition, and tobacco and substance use; fetal measurements including use of early ultrasound to help determine gestational age and detect multiple pregnancies; and a minimum of 8 contacts with health professionals throughout pregnancy – starting before 12 weeks – to identify and manage risk factors such as infections. If a woman experiences preterm labour or is at risk of preterm childbirth, treatments are available to help protect the preterm baby from future neurological impairment as well as difficulties with breathing and infection. These include antenatal steroids and tocolytic treatments to delay labour and antibiotics for preterm prolabour rupture of membranes (PPROM). ","Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks (2 months early) die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective care such as warmth, breastfeeding support and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties. In high-income countries, almost all these babies survive. Suboptimal use of technology in middle-income settings is causing an increased burden of disability among preterm babies who survive the neonatal period. Why does preterm birth happen? ",
Primary health care,Key facts Over 1 billion people worldwide are at risk of falling into poverty due to out-of-pocket health spending of 10% or more of their household budget. Overview ,,,"The concept of PHC has been repeatedly reinterpreted and redefined in the years since 1978, leading to confusion about the term and its practice. A clear and simple definition has been developed to facilitate the coordination of future PHC efforts at the global, national and local levels and to guide their implementation: ""PHC is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people’s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment."" PHC entails three inter-related and synergistic components, including: comprehensive integrated health services that embrace primary care as well as public health goods and functions as central pieces; multi-sectoral policies and actions to address the upstream and wider determinants of health; and engaging and empowering individuals, families and communities for increased social participation and enhanced self-care and self-reliance in health. ",Scaling up primary health care (PHC) interventions across low and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030. An estimated 75% of the projected health gains from the Sustainable Development Goals could be achieved through PHC. ,"For universal health coverage (UHC) to be truly universal, a shift is needed from health systems designed around diseases and institutions towards health systems designed for people, with people. PHC requires governments at all levels to underscore the importance of action beyond the health sector in order to pursue a whole-of government approach to health, including health-in-all-policies, a strong focus on equity and interventions that encompass the entire life-course. PHC addresses the broader determinants of health and focuses on the comprehensive and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and well-being. It provides whole-person care for health needs throughout the lifespan, not just for a set of specific diseases. Primary health care ensures people receive quality comprehensive care – ranging from promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care – as close as feasible to people’s everyday environment. "
Protecting workers' health,"Economically active people spend on an average about one third of their time at the workplace. Employment and working conditions have powerful effects on health equity. Good working conditions can provide social protection and status, personal development opportunities, and protection from physical and psychosocial hazards. They can also improve social relations and self esteem of employees and lead to positive health effects. ",,"Health risks at the workplace, such as heat, noise, dust, hazardous chemicals, unsafe machines and psychological stress, cause occupational diseases and can aggravate other health problems. Conditions of employment, occupation and the position in the workplace hierarchy also affect health. People working under stress or with precarious employment conditions are likely to smoke more, exercise less and have an unhealthy diet. In addition to general health care, all workers – and particularly those in high-risk occupations – need health services to assess and reduce exposure to occupational risks, as well as medical surveillance for early detection of occupational and work-related diseases and injuries. ","Primary care centres could provide some essential interventions for protecting workers’ health, such as advice for improving working conditions, detection of occupational diseases and health surveillance of workers, though in most countries the focus is still on medical treatment rather than prevention. What determines the health of workers ","Universal health coverage combines access to services needed to achieve good health (health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, including those that address health determinants) with the financial protection that prevents ill health leading to poverty. There are effective interventions to prevent occupational diseases. For example encapsulation of pollution sources, ventilation, noise control, substitution of dangerous chemicals, improvement of furniture and the organization of work. ",
Quality health services,Key facts ,,,"It has been estimated that high quality health systems could prevent 2.5 million deaths from cardiovascular disease, 900 000 deaths from tuberculosis, 1 million newborn deaths and half of all maternal deaths each year (2). Overview ","Between 5.7 and 8.4 million deaths are attributed to poor quality care each year in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which represents up to 15% of overall deaths in these countries (1). Sixty per cent of deaths in LMICs from conditions requiring health care occur due to poor quality care, whereas the remaining deaths result from non-utilization of the health system (2). ",
Rabies,Key facts ,"Once the virus infects the central nervous system and clinical symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in 100% of cases. However, rabies deaths are preventable with prompt post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) by stopping the virus from reaching the central nervous system. PEP consists of thorough wound washing, administration of a course of human rabies vaccine and, when indicated, rabies immunoglobulins (RIG). ","Rabies is a serious public health problem in over 150 countries and territories, mainly in Asia and Africa. It is a viral, zoonotic, neglected tropical disease that causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, with 40% being children under 15. Dog bites and scratches cause 99% of the human rabies cases, and can be prevented through dog vaccination and bite prevention. ","WHO and its global partners aim to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through a comprehensive One Health approach promoting mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to PEP, health worker training, improved surveillance, and bite prevention through community awareness. Overview ","If a person is bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, they should immediately and always seek PEP care. WHO and its global partners aim to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through a comprehensive One Health approach promoting mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to PEP, health worker training, improved surveillance, and bite prevention through community awareness.

Radon,"Overview Radon is a radioactive gas that has no smell, colour or taste. Radon is produced from the natural radioactive decay of uranium, which is found in all rocks and soils. Radon can also be found in water. ",,"Radon escapes from the ground into the air, where it decays and produces further radioactive particles. As we breathe, these particles are deposited on the cells lining the airways, where they can damage DNA and potentially cause lung cancer. Outdoors, radon quickly dilutes to very low concentrations and is generally not a problem. The average outdoor radon level (1) varies from 5 Bq/m3 to 15 Bq/m3. However, radon concentrations are higher indoors and in areas with minimal ventilation, with highest levels found in places like mines, caves and water treatment facilities. In buildings such as homes, schools, offices, radon levels can vary substantially from 10 Bq/m3 to more than 10 000 Bq/m3. Given the properties of radon, occupants of such buildings could unknowingly be living or working in very high radon levels. ","Well-tested, durable and cost-efficient methods exist for preventing radon in new buildings and reducing radon in existing dwellings. Radon prevention should be considered when new structures are built, particularly in radon-prone areas. In many countries of Europe, and in the United States of America and China, the inclusion of protective measures in new buildings are included in building codes. Some common ways of reducing radon levels in existing buildings include: ","The WHO guidelines for drinking water quality (2) (2011) recommend that screening levels for radon in drinking-water be set based on the national reference level for radon in air. In circumstances where high radon concentrations might be expected in drinking-water, it is prudent to measure radon concentrations. Straightforward and effective techniques exist to reduce the concentration of radon in drinking-water supplies by aeration or using granular activated carbon filters. Further guidance is available in Management of radioactivity in drinking-water (3) (2018). WHO response ",
Refugee and migrant health,"Overview Refugees and migrants have a variety of different physical and mental health needs, shaped by experiences in their country of origin, their migration journey, their host country’s entry and integration policies, and living and working conditions. These experiences can increase the vulnerability of refugees and migrants to chronic and infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health services, putting people already in vulnerable situations at heightened risk and hampering the ability of health systems to respond to their needs. ","Refugees and migrants may also be at risk of poor mental health because of traumatic or stressful experiences Many of them experience feelings of anxiety and sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, anger or aches and pains but for most people these symptoms of distress improve over time They may be at more risk of such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the host populations. Refugee and migrant health is also strongly related to the social determinants of health, such as employment, income, education and housing ","The term refugee is defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (3). There is no universally accepted definition of the term migrant (4). However, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs defines an international migrant as “any person who changes his or her country of usual residence”, and this definition includes people who are moving or have moved across an international border, regardless of legal status, duration of the stay abroad and causes for migration (5). Migrants may be given a migration status that limits their entitlement and access to health care. However, international law guarantees universal access in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) (6). ","Migrants, particularly in an irregular situation, are often excluded from national programmes for health promotion, disease prevention, treatment and care, as well as from financial protection in health. They can also face high user fees, low levels of health literacy, poor cultural competency among health providers, stigma and inadequate interpreting services. Barriers are even greater for people with disabilities. Women and girls may find difficulty in accessing sexual and gender-based violence protection and response services. Refugee and migrant children, especially unaccompanied minors, are more likely to experience traumatic events and stressful situations, such as exploitation and abuse, and may struggle to access health care. ","Refugees and migrants may arrive in the country of destination with poorly controlled non-communicable diseases, as they did not have care on the journey. Maternity care is usually a first point of contact with health systems for female refugees and migrants. Refugees and migrants may also be at risk of poor mental health because of traumatic or stressful experiences Many of them experience feelings of anxiety and sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, anger or aches and pains but for most people these symptoms of distress improve over time They may be at more risk of such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the host populations. ","The pandemic has highlighted existing inequities in access to and utilization of health services. Refugees and migrants have also suffered the negative economic impact of lockdown and travel restrictions. Income loss and health care insecurity may have particularly affected labour migrants. They may have also experienced legal and social insecurity caused by the postponement of decisions on migration status or a reduction of employment, legal and administrative services. WHO response "
Refugee and migrant mental health,Key facts Overview ,,,"In mid-2024, there were 122.6 million forcibly displaced people globally, including 68.3 million internally displaced people, 37.9 million refugees, 8 million asylum-seekers, and 5.8 million others needing international protection (1). Low- and middle-income countries host 71% of the world’s refugees and others needing international protection (1). ",Many refugees and migrants struggle to access mental health services and face disruptions in continuity of care. Refugees and migrants contribute positively to society and there are many evidence-based strategies to support them in reaching their full potential. ,"Leadership and advocacy. WHO’s Global Action Plan (2019–2023) is designed to promote the health of refugees and migrants through concerted international action and cooperation. The updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013–2030) focuses specifically on promoting mental well-being, and reducing the impact of mental health conditions. It emphasizes the need to address disparities in access to care and improve support for at-risk groups, including refugees and migrants. Through the Global Compact on Refugees Multistakeholder pledge, WHO is committed to integrating mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian, development and peace-building programmes. WHO also co-chairs the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, helping to ensure coordinated mental health responses in emergencies. "
Rehabilitation,Overview Rehabilitation is defined as “a set of interventions designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment”. ,"Put simply, rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family. It does so by working with the person and their family to address underlying health conditions and their symptoms, modifying their environment to better suit their needs, using assistive products, educating to strengthen self-management, and adapting tasks so that they can be performed more safely and independently. Together, these strategies can help an individual; overcome difficulties with thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around. Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has declined with age. ",,"working with a patient in intensive care to improve their breathing, prevent complications and speed their recovery after critical illness Rehabilitation is highly person-centred, meaning that the interventions selected for each individual are targeted to their goals and preferences. Rehabilitation can be provided in many different places, such as inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, outpatient physio- or occupational therapy practices, and community settings such as an individual’s home, a school or a workplace. ","Rehabilitation helps to minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes by equipping people with self-management strategies and the assistive products they require, or by addressing pain or other complications. As such, it contributes to healthy ageing. Rehabilitation is an investment, with cost benefits for both the individuals and society. It can help to avoid costly hospitalization, reduce hospital length of stay, and prevent re-admissions. As rehabilitation also enables individuals to engage in or return to work and employment, or to remain independent at home, it minimizes the need for financial or caregiver support. ","Rehabilitation can reduce the impact of a broad range of health conditions, including diseases (acute or chronic), illnesses or injuries. It complements other health interventions, such as medical and surgical interventions, helping to facilitate recovery and achieve the best outcome possible. In addition, rehabilitation can help to prevent, reduce or manage complications associated with many health conditions, such as in the context of spinal cord injury, stroke, or fractures. Rehabilitation helps to minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes by equipping people with self-management strategies and the assistive products they require, or by addressing pain or other complications. As such, it contributes to healthy ageing. "
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),Key Facts Overview ,Symptoms The first symptoms of RSV usually present between day 4–7 after exposure to the virus (2). ,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally, as well as causing substantial burden of severe respiratory disease among elderly persons. Each year RSV causes over 3.6 million hospitalizations and about 100 000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. Most paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care. ","There are two licensed immunization products for prevention of RSV disease in young infants: a long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to infants soon after birth and a maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and persons in the latter part of pregnancy. Three vaccines are licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in elderly persons and adults with certain underlying illnesses, like lung and heart disease. ","Each year, RSV causes an estimated 3.6 million RSV-associated hospitalizations and approximatively 100 000 RSV-attributable deaths in children under 5 years of age worldwide (3). Approximately half of RSV deaths among children occur in infants under the age of 6 months. Most paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care (3). The global estimates of adult RSV disease are not known; in the United States of America, it has been estimated that RSV results in up to 160 000 hospitalizations and 10 000 deaths among adults over 65 years of age. The hospitalization rate for adults infected with RSV is higher among individuals with underlying conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure (4). Most countries demonstrate RSV seasonality, with most annual RSV infections occurring over a several month period (5). In temperate climates, RSV causes seasonal epidemics, tending to occur in late fall and winter, with an average duration of elevated viral circulation of five months. Although not as sharply defined, most sub-tropical and tropical countries also experience consistent months of high RSV circulation during each year but with no clear seasonality patterns (5, 6). ","Severe lung disease can result in low oxygen levels in the body, respiratory muscle fatigue and can sometimes result in death. RSV-LRTI in early life may lead to long-term respiratory consequences, including repeat hospitalizations for respiratory illness during infancy, recurrent wheeze and/or asthma, and impaired lung health beyond infancy (2). RSV infection in elderly adults can exacerbate chronic underlying illnesses, such as lung and heart disease (4). "
Rheumatic heart disease,Key facts Rheumatic heart disease is the most commonly acquired heart disease in people under age 25. Rheumatic heart disease affects an estimated 55 million people worldwide and claims approximately 360 000 lives each year – the large majority in low- or middle-income countries. ,Signs and symptoms Rheumatic fever symptoms can include: ,"The disease results from damage to heart valves caused by one or several episodes of rheumatic fever, an autoimmune inflammatory reaction to throat infection caused by group A streptococci (streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat). It most commonly occurs in childhood and can lead to death or life-long disability. ","Rheumatic heart disease can be prevented by preventing streptococcal infections through addressing poverty and improving living and housing standards, or prompt treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics when they do occur. Overview ","Treatment There is no cure for rheumatic heart disease and the damage to the heart valves is permanent. Patients with severe rheumatic heart disease will often require surgery to replace or repair the damaged valve or valves. Depending on the severity of disease, medication may also be needed to treat symptoms of heart failure or heart rhythm abnormalities. Medications which thin the blood to reduce the risk of blood clots may also be needed. In the case of serious disease surgery may be required to repair or replace the heart valves. This is often not available in low-income settings, or when it is available the costs may be too high if not covered as part of national health plans, putting families under increased financial strain.

Rheumatoid arthritis,Overview ,"Common symptoms include chronic pain, stiffness, tenderness, heat and swelling in the joints. RA can make it hard to move and perform daily activities. The causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Risk factors include smoking, obesity and exposure to air pollution. Women and older people have a higher risk of developing RA. ","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation around the body and commonly presents with pain in the joints. Untreated, RA can cause severe damage to the joints and their surrounding tissue. It can lead to heart, lung or nervous system problems. ","Prevention and control Several key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent rheumatoid arthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing exposure to inhaled silica, dusts and occupational risks, and lifestyle related behaviours (e.g., prevention of/stop smoking, healthy nutrition, physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, maintaining good dental hygiene) play an important role. Some evidence also suggests breastfeeding may be protective to the mother (4). ","If diagnosed timely, symptoms and disease progression can be controlled with pharmacological treatment, and optimal functioning can be maintained through rehabilitation (including the use of assistive products). In cases with severe joint damage, surgical procedures, including joint replacement, may help to restore movement or manage pain, and maintain physical function. Scope of the problem ",Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition that impacts many aspects of life. Lifestyle changes are often needed for individuals and their families. Education and support help people with rheumatoid arthritis to develop strategies to cope with the disease. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity and a nutritious diet. 
Rift Valley fever,Key facts Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Overview ,The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. Outbreaks in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination. ,Rift Valley fever is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. RVF virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep in the Rift Valley of Kenya. ,"An inactivated vaccine has been developed for human use. However, this vaccine is not licensed and is not commercially available. It has been used experimentally to protect veterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of exposure to RVF. Other candidate vaccines are under investigation. Prevention and control ","To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when standard infection control precautions have been implemented. . Symptoms in humans ","the importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light-coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species; vector control using larviciding measures at mosquito breeding sites if they can be clearly identified and are limited in size and extent. During periods of flooding the number and extent of breeding sites is usually too high for larviciding measures to be feasible. "
Ringworm (tinea),Key facts Overview ,"Symptoms include itching, redness, and a ring-shaped rash. It is typically treated with antifungal medications. ","Ringworm is a common fungal infection of the skin caused by dermatophyte fungi that have adapted to live on keratin, the hard fibrous protein found in skin and hair. Ringworm accounts for roughly half of the estimated 650 million fungal skin infections globally (1). ","In addition to medication, keeping the affected area clean and dry can help promote healing and prevent the spread of infection. Prevention ","A newly described ringworm species has spread widely and is now common in countries of South-East Asia. It has also spread beyond this to Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas. It is also often resistant to treatment with antifungal medicines. Close contact with an infected person or animal increases the risk of transmission. ",
Road traffic injuries,Key facts Approximately 1.19 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Overview ,,"Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. 92% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have around 60% of the world's vehicles. ","Safe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries’ manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries – both to those in the vehicle and those out of it – is considerably increased. Inadequate post-crash care ","Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Who is at risk? ","An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65 km/h). "
Rubella,Key facts Rubella is a contagious viral infection transmitted by airborne droplets that occurs most often in children and young adults. Overview ,"Symptoms In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (<39°C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50–80% of cases, lasts 1–3 days and usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3–10 days. ","Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects, accounting for an estimated 100 000 infants born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) each year worldwide. Rubella virus infection during pregnancy may result in miscarriage, fetal death or CRS. The most severe damage occurs early in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. ","Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with rubella or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus. There were an estimated 17 865 cases of rubella in 78 countries in 2022, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine. ","Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction – many of which require costly therapy, surgeries and other expensive care. The highest risk of CRS is in countries where women of childbearing age do not have immunity to the disease (either through vaccination or from having had rubella). Before the introduction of the vaccine, up to 4 babies in every 1000 live births were born with CRS. ","M&RP is part of IA2030, an ambitious global strategy to maximize the lifesaving impact of vaccines – one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions of all time. IA2030 aims to avert over 50 million deaths by 2030 through access to essential vaccines and help build healthcare systems that can withstand the impact of pandemics and deliver rapid vaccination response. "
Salmonella (non-typhoidal),,"The onset of disease symptoms occurs 6–72 hours (usually 12–36 hours) after ingestion of Salmonella, and illness lasts 2–7 days. Symptoms of salmonellosis are relatively mild and patients will make a recovery without specific treatment in most cases. However, in some cases, particularly in children and elderly patients, the associated dehydration can become severe and life-threatening. ","The burden of foodborne diseases is substantial: every year almost 1 in 10 people fall ill and 33 million of healthy life years are lost. Foodborne diseases can be severe, especially for young children. Diarrhoeal diseases are the most common illnesses resulting from unsafe food, 550 million people falling ill each year, including 220 million children under the age of 5 years. Salmonella is 1 of the 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases. Salmonella is a gram negative rods genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Within 2 species, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica, over 2500 different serotypes or serovars have been identified to date. Salmonella is a ubiquitous and hardy bacteria that can survive several weeks in a dry environment and several months in water. ","Prevention methods Prevention requires control measures at all stages of the food chain, from agricultural production, to processing, manufacturing and preparation of foods in both commercial establishments and at home. ","While all serotypes can cause disease in humans, a few are host-specific and can reside in only one or a few animal species: for example, Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin in cattle and Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis in pigs. When these particular serotypes cause disease in humans, it is often invasive and can be life-threatening. Most serotypes, however, are present in a wide range of hosts. Typically, such serotypes cause gastroenteritis, which is often uncomplicated and does not need treatment, but disease can be severe in the young, the elderly, and patients with weakened immunity. This group features Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, the two most important serotypes of Salmonella transmitted from animals to humans in most parts of the world. The disease ","In partnership with other stakeholders, WHO is strongly advocating the importance of food safety as an essential element in ensuring access to safe and nutritious diets. WHO is providing policies and recommendations that cover the entire food chain from production to consumption, making use of different types of expertise across different sectors. WHO is working towards the strengthening of food safety systems in an increasingly globalized world. Setting international food safety standards, enhancing disease surveillance, educating consumers and training food handlers in safe food handling are amongst the most critical interventions in the prevention of foodborne illnesses. "
Sand and dust storms,Key facts Sand and dust storm episodes contribute directly to air pollution by increasing particulate matter concentrations. In some regions dust is a main source of air pollution from particulate matter. Overview ,,"Airborne dust is not restricted to geographical boundaries and so requires regional cooperation across nations to address the problem. Being a global phenomenon that affects specific areas, it is a challenge for the health sector because of the difficulty in characterizing the exposure and the limited evidence on its long-term health effects. There is also a gap between health evidence in dust emitting regions and receptor regions, as desert dust events often involve long-range transport over great distances (>1000 km). Most of the health studies related to SDS events occur in high-income countries in receptor regions. Currently, the response from governments is based on the knowledge of short terms health effects, limited early warning systems and the provision of information to vulnerable groups in real time, as well as the impact of emergency visits. ","Going forward there is a need for strengthened collaboration between medical and environmental scientists to explore better exposure assessment, dust size fraction and specific chemical composition. The health sector should also address the gaps in knowledge and response on the health impacts of desert dust in the longer term and continue strengthening collaboration with appropriate government entities to provide a timely and effective public health response. Furthermore, collaborative and multi-country research – for both short- and long-term health impacts of SDS as well as the synergistic effects of both exposure to heat and particulate matter – is critical to protecting public health. Starting in 2023, the International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms will be observed every year on 12 July. ","An estimated 25% of dust emissions originates from human activities, including deforestation, land degradation, unsustainable land management, climate change and water mismanagement (1). Globally, 330 million people are exposed daily to particles transported by wind, sometimes for thousands of kilometres from source areas (2). ","Sand and dust storms present a formidable, widespread threat to health and hinder the achievement of sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental dimensions. Originating from the land, these particles of various size and composition get lifted in the air, creating storms. This is especially the case in dry regions, where vegetation is sparse or absent, such as deserts and agricultural land impacted by drought. Their wide impact goes beyond human health and air quality, as it also impacts agriculture, environment, industry, transport and water quality. There is a wealth of scientific evidence on associations between desert dust and sand storms and adverse short term health effects, yet there is a need for more research on the health impacts of SDS, including harmonized protocol to assess exposure, more studies in dust-emitting areas as well as long term health effects. "
Sanitation,"Key facts In 2022, 57% of the global population (4.6 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service. Over 1.5 billion people still do not have basic sanitation services, such as private toilets or latrines. Overview ",,"reducing the spread of intestinal worms, schistosomiasis and trachoma, which are neglected tropical diseases that cause suffering for millions; reducing the severity and impact of malnutrition; ","Diarrhoea remains a major killer but is largely preventable. Better water, sanitation, and hygiene could prevent the deaths among children aged under 5 years, 395 000 in the year 2019. Open defecation perpetuates a vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The countries where open defection is most widespread have the highest number of deaths of children aged under 5 years as well as the highest levels of malnutrition and poverty, and big disparities of wealth. ","In 2020, 44% of the household wastewater generated globally was discharged without safe treatment (1). At least 10% of the world’s population is thought to consume food irrigated by wastewater. ","Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost opportunities for education and work. Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery, as well as typhoid, intestinal worm infections and polio. It exacerbates stunting and contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. "
Scabies,Overview ,Symptoms Symptoms of scabies usually begin 4–6 weeks after infestation. Sometimes there are visible signs before symptoms begin. ,"Scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin and lay eggs, causing intense itching and a rash. Scabies can lead to skin sores and serious complications like septicaemia (a bloodstream infection), heart disease and kidney problems. It is treated using creams or oral medications. ",Prevention Treating scabies as soon as possible is the best way to prevent outbreaks. The mites that cause scabies usually die after 2–3 days away from human skin. ,"Scabies is found in every country but is particularly common in many resource-poor tropical settings, particularly in children and older people. Prevalence among children in these settings may vary from 5% up to 50%. Recurrent infestations are common. The sheer burden of scabies infestation and its complications imposes a major cost on health care systems. Cases are sporadic in high-income countries, yet outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities contribute to significant economic cost in national health services. Several studies have shown that outbreaks of scabies are a major risk factor for kidney disease in the form of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. A growing body of evidence also implicates impetigo caused by Streptococcus pyogenes in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. ",
Schistosomiasis,Overview ,Symptoms Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused mainly by the body’s reaction to the worms’ eggs. ,"Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematode worms) of the genus Schistosoma. Estimates show that at least 251.4 million people required preventive treatment in 2021. Preventive treatment, which should be repeated over a number of years, will reduce and prevent morbidity. Schistosomiasis transmission has been reported from 78 countries. However, preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis, where people and communities are targeted for large-scale treatment, is only required in 51 endemic countries with moderate-to-high transmission. Infection and transmission ","Prevention and control The control of schistosomiasis is based on large-scale treatment of at-risk population groups, access to safe water, improved sanitation, hygiene education and behaviour change, and snail control and environmental management. ","Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is estimated that at least 90% of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa. There are 2 major forms of schistosomiasis – intestinal and urogenital – caused by 5 main species of blood fluke. ","The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Kidney damage and fibrosis of the bladder and ureter are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Chronic schistosomiasis may affect people’s ability to work and in some cases can result in death. The number of deaths due to schistosomiasis is difficult to estimate because of hidden pathologies such as liver and kidney failure, bladder cancer and ectopic pregnancies due to female genital schistosomiasis.

Schizophrenia,"persistent delusions: the person has fixed beliefs that something is true, despite evidence to the contrary; ",Symptoms Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in the way reality is perceived and changes in behaviour related to: ,Causes of schizophrenia Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia.  Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia. Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder. ,,"People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment. During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms. During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion. ","Magnitude and impact Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people (0.32%) worldwide. This rate is 1 in 222 people (0.45%) among adults (2). It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women. "
Self-care for health and well-being,Key facts Overview ,,"Before recommending specific self-care interventions, it is important to have evidence that they are beneficial to health and cause no harm at individual and/or population levels. Use of unregulated and substandard products, incorrect or unclear health information or lack of access to health and care workers and/or health facilities for guidance or management of side effects or complications are challenges that need to be addressed when promoting or generating demand for these interventions. Currently one of the biggest challenges is ensuring that products are available to those who need them and that they do not place added financial burden on individuals. ","Self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote and maintain their own health, prevent disease, and to cope with illness – with or without the support of a health or care worker. Self-care interventions can include medicines, devices, diagnostics and digital tools.  Self-care actions include practices, habits, and lifestyle choices. ","Self-sampling of human papilloma virus (HPV) is an effective self-care intervention to screen for cervical cancer. Male and female condoms are highly effective self-care interventions in preventing unwanted pregnancies, and STIs, including HIV.  Non-judgmental, person-centred information should be provided to support condom use. ",
Sepsis,Key facts Overview ,Signs and symptoms Sepsis is a medical emergency. It can cause different signs and symptoms at different times. People who think they may have sepsis should seek medical care right away. ,"Sepsis is one of the most frequent causes of death worldwide, but there are challenges in collecting reliable data at the population level (1). From data published in 2020, there were 48.9 million cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths worldwide, representing 20% of all global deaths (2). ","Implementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis. Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical management of sepsis, such as optimal antimicrobial use and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to increase the likelihood of survival. Even though the onset of sepsis can be acute and poses a short-term mortality burden, it can also be the cause of significant long-term morbidity requiring treatment and support. Thus, sepsis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Who is at risk? ","For every 1000 hospitalized patients, an estimated 15 patients will develop sepsis as a complication of receiving health care. While sepsis can affect any individual worldwide, significant regional disparities in incidence and mortality exist with the highest rates in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) (2). ","draw attention to public health impacts of sepsis and estimate the global burden of sepsis; support Member States to define and implement standards and establish guidelines, infrastructure, laboratory capacity, strategies and tools for identifying, reducing incidence of, and morbidity and mortality due to sepsis; and "
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),"Key facts More than 1 million curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired every day worldwide in people 15–49 years old, the majority of which are asymptomatic. In 2020 there were an estimated 374 million new infections in people 15–49 years with 1 of 4 curable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. Overview ","STIs are often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can be non-specific. Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs (using molecular technology) are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, they are largely unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Even in countries where testing is available, it is often expensive and not widely accessible. In addition, the time it takes for results to be received is often long. As a result, follow-up can be impeded and care or treatment can be incomplete. ","An estimated 520 million people aged 15–49 years (13%) worldwide have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, the main cause of genital herpes (1). Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with over 311 000 cervical cancer deaths each year (2). ","In addition, emerging outbreaks of new infections that can be acquired by sexual contact such as mpox, Shigella sonnei, Neisseria meningitidis, Ebola and Zika, as well as re-emergence of neglected STIs such as lymphogranuloma venereum. These herald increasing challenges in the provision of adequate services for STIs prevention and control. Scope of the problem ","Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 viral STIs: hepatitis B and HPV. These vaccines have represented major advances in STI prevention. By the end of 2023, the HPV vaccine had been introduced as part of routine immunization programmes in 140 countries, primarily high- and middle-income countries. To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem globally, high coverage targets for HPV vaccination, screening and treatment of precancerous lesions, and management of cancer must be reached by 2030 and maintained at this high level for decades. Research to develop vaccines against genital herpes is advanced, with several vaccine candidates in early clinical development. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the vaccine to prevent meningitis (MenB) provides some cross-protection against gonorrhoea. More research into vaccines for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis are needed. ","STIs have a direct impact on sexual and reproductive health through stigmatization, infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications and can increase the risk of HIV. Drug resistance is a major threat to reducing the burden of STIs worldwide. "
Shingles (herpes zoster),Key facts Overview ,"Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains inactive in the body. Shingles occurs when the virus reactivates later in life, often when the immune system is weakened. The rash typically appears on one side of the body, often as a single stripe of blisters. The symptoms of shingles can include pain, itching, tingling and numbness, as well as fever, headache, chills and fatigue. Shingles is not contagious, but the virus can be spread to someone who has never had chickenpox, causing chickenpox. A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent shingles and its complications. Treatment with antiviral medications can reduce the severity and duration of shingles, especially if started early. Complications can be severe, especially for those who are immunocompromised. Risk factors ","Shingles is a painful rash caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who has had chickenpox can develop shingles, although it is more common in adults over 50 years of age. ","A safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent shingles and its complications. Antiviral medications can reduce the severity and duration of shingles, especially if started early. ","A rash typically appears on one side of the body, often as a single stripe or band of blisters. It can also appear on the face, sometimes near the eye. If it occurs near the eye, it is a medical emergency. Contact your health-care provider right away. The rash consists of small, fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over within a few days. ",
Snakebite envenoming,Overview ,,"Bites by venomous snakes can cause acute medical emergencies involving severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, cause bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhage, cause irreversible kidney failure and severe local tissue destruction that can cause permanent disability and limb amputation. Children may suffer more severe effects and can experience the effects more quickly than adults due to their smaller body mass. In contrast to many other serious health conditions, a highly effective treatment exists. Most deaths and serious consequences of snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible. High quality snake antivenoms are the most effective treatment to prevent or reverse most of the venomous effects of snake bites. They are included in the WHO List of essential medicines and should be part of any primary health care package where snake bites occur. ",,"Snake bite is a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries. Most of these occur in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In Asia up to 2 million people are envenomed by snakes each year, while in Africa there are an estimated 435 000 to 580 000 snake bites annually that need treatment. Envenoming affects women, children and farmers in poor rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. The highest burden occurs in countries where health systems are weakest and medical resources sparse. Bites by venomous snakes can cause acute medical emergencies involving severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, cause bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhage, cause irreversible kidney failure and severe local tissue destruction that can cause permanent disability and limb amputation. Children may suffer more severe effects and can experience the effects more quickly than adults due to their smaller body mass. ","A combination of strategic and risk-based placement of antivenoms, suitable healthcare staff training, availability of affordable, safe and effective antivenoms and equipment, along with the promotion of responsible health-seeking behaviours, can lead better outcomes for snakebite patients and a considerable reduction in the impact of snakebite-related morbidity and mortality. However, the combination of poor geographical access to and inadequate health services in remote communities hinders the chance of receiving appropriate treatment. Health systems in many countries where snake bites are common often lack the infrastructure and resources to collect robust statistical data on the problem. Assessing the true impact is further complicated by the fact that cases reported to health ministries by clinics and hospitals are often only a small proportion of the actual burden because many victims never reach primary care facilities and are therefore unreported. This is contributed to by socio-economic and cultural factors that influence treatment-seeking behaviour with many victims opting for traditional practices rather than hospital care. "
Social determinants of health,"Key facts Widening health inequities undermine health and well-being across countries and cut lives short. Between countries, the difference in life expectancy gap is as wide as 33 years. Within countries, where data are available, health gaps between social groups are often growing. People with higher educational attainment have better health and life spans than their less educated peers at a population level (1,2). Overview ",,"The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age, and the wider forces that shape the conditions of daily life. Most of our health is determined by these non-medical root causes of ill health, which include quality education, access to nutritious food, and decent housing and working conditions. Wider forces include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness but also promotes healthy lives and equity. ","Increasing investments by just 0.1% of GDP in each of social protection, labour market and housing and community policies could markedly improve health for 150 000 people in a country of 40 million within four years. Health inequities will not be overcome unless economic inequality, structural discrimination, conflict and climate disruption are addressed. ","Social injustice continues to kill on a grand scale, in both high- and low-income countries, as the world fails to tackle the non-medical root causes of ill health. Social determinants of health equity outweigh genetic influences or health-care access in influencing health outcomes. Within countries, life expectancy varies by decades, depending on which area you live in and the social group to which you belong. Where data are available, within country health inequities are often growing. ","Structural discrimination, such as intersecting racism and gender inequality, results in 2.4 billion women of working age lacking equal economic opportunities (6), impacting the health of them and their families. The debt burden of the world’s poorest countries pulls them further away from being able to fund essential investments in social determinants of health equity. The total value of interest payments made by the world’s 75 poorest countries has quadrupled over the past decade (7). "
Sodium reduction,"Key facts Almost all populations are consuming too much sodium. The global mean intake of adults is 4310 mg/day sodium (equivalent to 10.78 g/day salt) (1). This is more than double the World Health Organization recommendation for adults of less than 2000 mg/day sodium (equivalent to < 5 g/day salt, or approximately one teaspoon). Overview ",,"An estimated 1.89 million deaths each year are associated with consuming too much sodium, a well-established cause of raised blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (2). Reducing sodium intake is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve health and reduce the burden of noncommunicable diseases, as it can avert many cardiovascular events and deaths at very low total programme costs. WHO recommends several sodium-related best buy policies as practical steps that countries can take to prevent cardiovascular disease and its associated costs. These include lowering sodium content in foods; implementing front-of-pack labelling; mass media campaigns; and public food procurement and service. ","WHO has identified a set of evidence-based best buy interventions to tackle noncommunicable diseases. It undertaken immediately, these interventions are expected to accelerate results in terms of lives saved, healthy years of life gained, cases of disease prevented, and costs avoided. There are 4 best buys for sodium reduction: ",,"In 2010, the World Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and strengthening existing ones to reduce the impact of unhealthy food marketing on children. The WHO Regional Offices have developed nutrient profile models that countries can use as a tool to implement these marketing recommendations. In 2011, world leaders committed to reducing people’s exposure to unhealthy diets. The commitment was made through a Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. "
Soil-transmitted helminth infections,Overview ,"Morbidity and symptoms Morbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness, and impaired growth and physical development. ","The main species that infect people are the roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). These STH species are normally addressed as a group because they need similar diagnostic procedures and respond to the same medicines. Strongyloides stercoralis is an intestinal helminth with peculiar characteristics: the parasite requires different diagnostic methods than other soil-transmitted helminthiases, and for this reason is frequently not identified. In addition, the parasite is not sensitive to albendazole or mebendazole and therefore not impacted by large-scale preventive treatment campaigns targeting other soil-transmitted helminthiases. ","Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most common infections worldwide with an estimated 1.5 billion infected people or 24% of the world’s population. These infections affect the poorest and most deprived communities with poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in tropical and subtropical areas, with the highest prevalence reported from sub-Saharan Africa, China, South America and Asia. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces, which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor. Over 260 million preschool-age children, 654 million school-age children,108 million adolescent girls and 138.8 million pregnant and lactating women live in areas where these parasites are intensively transmitted, and are in need of treatment and preventive interventions. Globally over 600 million people are estimated to be infected by S. stercoralis; however, since also this parasite is transmitted in areas where sanitation is poor, its geographical distribution overlaps with the one of the other soil-transmitted helminthiases. ","eggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled; eggs are ingested from contaminated water sources; and ","WHO added the control of morbidity due to S. stercoralis as an objective for 2030. This is possible because of the current availability of pre-qualified ivermectin at affordable cost. Distribution of ivermectin can be organized through the platforms used to control the other soil-transmitted helminthiases. Pilot interventions are presently in place to refine the strategy and evaluate its impact. In 2021, over 500 million children were treated with anthelminthic medicines in endemic countries, corresponding to 62% of all children at risk. In addition, more than 99 million of women of reproductive age were treated with albendazole through the lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of Disease Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost every year because of STH reduced by more than 50%, which correspond to the period of scaling up of preventive chemotherapy (PC) for STH in endemic countries. "
Spinal cord injury,"Spinal cord injury Key facts Globally, over 15 million people are living with spinal cord injury (SCI). ","Signs and symptoms Depending on injury severity and location, people with SCI can experience ","People with SCI are at risk of developing debilitating and even life-threatening secondary conditions, which can cause premature mortality. SCI is associated with lower school enrolment and economic participation rates, carrying substantial individual and societal costs. ","Most SCI cases are due to trauma, including falls, road traffic injuries or violence, and are thus preventable. People with SCI are at risk of developing debilitating and even life-threatening secondary conditions, which can cause premature mortality. ","Effective prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and ongoing health care are essential to alleviate the global burden of SCI. Overview ","Many people with SCI, their carers and families face substantial social and economic consequences. While existing data limit global cost estimates of SCI, its economic burden is significant. Indirect costs (for example, lost earnings) often exceed direct costs, which are highest in the first year after SCI onset, with much of the cost borne by people with SCI. Signs and symptoms "
Sporotrichosis,Key facts Overview ,"Signs and symptoms Sporotrichosis most commonly presents with nodules and plaques on exposed skin sites such as the face, legs or arms. These may be restricted to one site (fixed pattern). Alternatively, the nodules may be arranged in lines along the course of lymphatic vessels (lymphocutaneous pattern), known as sporotrichoid spread. This form is typical of sporotrichosis but a similar clinical pattern can occur with other neglected tropical diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. Both nodules and plaques can ulcerate. Sporotrichosis can also affect the mucous membranes such as the mouth and other sites including the eyes. ","Sporotrichosis is an infection under the skin caused by different species of the fungus Sporothrix. Infections occur sporadically in tropical and subtropical countries. There are areas where it is hyperendemic, causing between 25 to 100 cases per 100 000 persons. ","Prevention and control There are no recognized preventive measures apart from early identification and treatment of infected cats. The use of gloves, protective clothing and shoes when handling roses, hay and sphagnum moss have the potential to reduce infections. ",Treatment The infection responds to treatment with oral itraconazole or terbinafine. Saturated solutions of potassium iodide taken by mouth have also been used but require dispensing pharmacy skills to make up the medicine. Intravenous amphotericin B can be used for the rare systemic forms of sporotrichosis. ,"Global impact Sporotrichosis is a disabling disease that reduces social interaction. Infections caused by cat-acquired S. brasiliensis infections often require longer courses of treatment, e.g. 3–4 months. Control of this variant also requires collaboration between medical and veterinary teams. The association with some outbreaks of sporotrichosis with weather events leading to flooding suggest that occurrence of this mycosis may be affected by climate change. "
Substandard and falsified medical products,Key facts Substandard and falsified medical products affect people all around the world. At least 1 in 10 medicines in low- and middle-income countries are substandard or falsified. Overview ,,,"Increasingly sophisticated networks manufacture these products, exploiting the demand for affordable medical treatments. The rise in online sales through unauthorized sites has further exacerbated the issue, allowing falsified products to reach consumers more easily. Tackling this problem necessitates robust legal frameworks, regional and international cooperation, heightened public awareness and stronger enforcement measures. These steps are crucial to safeguarding the integrity of health systems and ensuring the availability of safe and effective medical products for prevention, treatment and care. Global cooperation, robust regulations, legal frameworks and public awareness are essential to tackle the issue and ensure that all people have access to safe and effective medical products. ","Both substandard and falsified medical products put patients’ health at risk, undermine the effectiveness of health systems, and erode trust in health and care providers. Sometimes, certain problems with health affect some countries more than others. These problems can happen in places where everyone does not have access to healthcare. When that happens, people might buy medical products from places that are not permitted to sell them. Even in wealthy countries, the global trade and transportation of medicines pose significant risks. These risks stem from how medicines are manufactured and distributed across the world. To mitigate this, coordinated efforts are needed; governments, healthcare professionals and manufacturers must collaborate to enforce regulations and educate the public on safety measures. Scope of the problem ","Substandard and falsified medical products are a significant global health problem, impacting millions of people and compromising health systems worldwide. These products can be found in all countries, impacting all types of medical products, including life-saving treatments like vaccines, antibiotics and cancer therapies. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that 1 in 10 medicines in low- and middle-income countries failed quality control tests, suggesting the product is substandard or falsified. This can lead to serious health risks, treatment failures and even death. The economic burden is also substantial, with billions of dollars lost annually due to ineffective treatments, increased healthcare costs and loss of productivity. For patients, the consequences are dire: relying on ineffective or harmful products can exacerbate illnesses, lead to prolonged suffering and contribute to drug resistance, making diseases harder to treat. "
Sugars and dental caries,"Dental caries is a major public health problem globally and is the most widespread noncommunicable disease (NCD). It is also the most prevalent condition included in the 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, ranking first for decay of permanent teeth (2.3 billion people) and 12th for deciduous teeth (560 million children). ","Dental caries develops over time; loss of tooth substance (enamel and dentine) is caused by acid production resulting from bacterial metabolism of sugars. Early stages are often without symptoms, but advanced stages of dental caries may lead to pain, infections and abscesses, or even sepsis. It has been estimated that, globally in 2010, US$ 298 billion was spent on direct costs associated with dental caries. In addition, indirect costs came to US$ 144 billion, with the total financial cost reaching US$ 442 billion in 2010. ","Teeth affected by caries are often extracted (pulled out) when they cause pain or discomfort. Severe dental caries can impair quality of life, including difficulties in eating and sleeping, and in its advanced stages (abscesses), it may result in pain and chronic systemic infection or adverse growth patterns. Tooth decay is a frequent cause of absence from school or work. ","Dental caries can be prevented by avoiding dietary free sugars. Moreover, dental caries is largely preventable through simple and cost-effective population-wide and individual interventions, whereas treatment is costly, and is often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. Teeth affected by caries are often extracted (pulled out) when they cause pain or discomfort. ",It is important that population-wide prevention interventions are universally available and accessible. Such interventions include the use of fluoride and comprehensive patient-centred essential oral health care. Challenges ,"Dental caries disproportionally affect poor and disadvantaged populations, which have lower access to prevention and care. Often, dental caries does not receive adequate priority in health planning due to an underestimation of the true burden and impact of the disease. The focus of interventions is generally characterized by an isolated disease approach and a focus on costly clinical treatment, rather than on integrated cost-effective public health strategies that address entire populations and focus on common risk factors for NCDs. Economic growth is associated with increased access to sugar-sweetened beverages and other dietary sources of free sugars. Increased availability of sugars in the absence of adequate oral health preventive measures is associated with a marked increase in the burden of oral disease. "
Suicide,Key facts More than 720 000 people die due to suicide every year. Overview ,,Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds. Seventy-three per cent of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. ,"Suicide is a serious public health problem that requires a public health response. With timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions, suicides can be prevented. For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed. Who is at risk? ","In 2021, WHO launched LIVE LIFE: an implementation guide for suicide prevention in countries. Accompanying resources to support the implementation of the four key LIVE LIFE interventions have also been published including the 2024 brochure on Preventing suicide by phasing out highly hazardous pesticides to support limiting access to means, Preventing suicide: a resource for media professionals, update 2023 to encourage responsible reporting of suicide, and the Helping Adolescents Thrive toolkit to foster socio-emotional life-skills among young people. At the health sector level, suicide/self-harm is one of the priority conditions in the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which provides evidence-based technical guidance to scale up service provision and care in countries for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. The mhGAP Intervention Guide (‎mhGAP-IG)‎ includes a specific module for suicide and self-harm to support early identification, assessment, management and follow-up. Through the LIVE LIFE initiative, governments are encouraged and supported to implement a suite of evidence-based interventions and foundational pillars for suicide prevention. ",
Syphilis,Key facts Most infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized. WHO estimates that 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old acquired syphilis in 2022. Overview ,"Many people with syphilis do not have symptoms or do not notice them. Syphilis is transmitted during oral, vaginal and anal sex, in pregnancy and through blood transfusion. Syphilis in pregnancy may lead to stillbirth, newborn death and babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis). ","Syphilis is a preventable and curable bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). If untreated, it can cause serious health issues. Many people with syphilis do not have symptoms or do not notice them. ","Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex can prevent syphilis. Rapid tests can provide results in a few minutes, which allows treatment initiation on the same clinic visit. ","Many people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms. They can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers. Untreated, syphilis lasts many years. Syphilis has several stages. Primary syphilis (first stage): ","Untreated syphilis in pregnancy may lead to severe negative consequences, such as stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity, low birth weight and life-long health problems to the infected infant. Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis "
Taeniasis/cysticercosis,Transmission and burden ,"Infection with the T. solium tapeworm occurs when a person eats raw or undercooked, infected pork. Infection with the tapeworm causes few clinical symptoms. Tapeworm eggs passed in the faeces with the tapeworm carrier are infective for pigs. T. solium eggs may also infect humans if they are ingested by a person (via the fecal-oral route, or by ingesting contaminated food or water), causing infection with the larval parasite in the tissues (human cysticercosis). Human cysticercosis can result in devastating effects on human health. The larvae (cysticerci) may develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis (NCC). Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions and epileptic seizures and can be fatal. ","Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by 3 species of tapeworm: Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Taenia asiatica. Humans can become infected with T. saginata or T. asiatica when they consume infected beef meat or pig liver tissue, respectively, which has not been adequately cooked, but taeniasis due to T. saginata or T. asiatica has no major impact on human health. Therefore, this fact sheet refers to the transmission and health impacts of T. solium only. ","Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic. In specific communities the association between NCC and epilepsy can be up to 70%. In poor remote settings where the disease is present, epilepsy is difficult to diagnose and treat, and causes major stigma, especially in girls and women (where it is commonly associated to witchcraft). Cysticercosis mainly affects the health and livelihoods of subsistence farming communities in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It also reduces the market value of pigs and makes pork unsafe to eat. In 2015, the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group identified T. solium as a leading cause of deaths from food-borne diseases, resulting in a considerable total of 2.8 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The total number of people suffering from NCC, including symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, is estimated to be between 2.56–8.30 million, based on the range of epilepsy prevalence data available. Although 70% of patients with epilepsy could lead a normal life if treated correctly, poverty, ignorance of the disease, inadequate infrastructure in health or lack of access to medication, cause 75% people with this condition to be treated poorly, if treated at all. ","These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for several years. It is considered that untreated infections with T. solium tapeworms generally persist for 2–3 years. In the case of cysticercosis due to T. solium, the incubation period prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for many years. ",Core “rapid impact” interventions: treatment of human taeniasis; 
Tetanus,"Key facts Tetanus is acquired through infection of a cut or wound with the spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, and most cases occur within 14 days of infection. Tetanus cannot be transmitted from person to person. Overview ",Symptoms and diagnosis The incubation period of tetanus varies between 3 and 21 days after infection. Most cases occur within 14 days. ,"Tetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tracts/feces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years. Anyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus. ","Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV). However, people who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again. The majority of reported tetanus cases are birth-associated among newborn babies and mothers who have not been sufficiently vaccinated with TTCV. ",Treatment Tetanus is a medical emergency requiring: ,
The top 10 causes of death,"Causes of death can be grouped into three categories: communicable (infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions), noncommunicable (chronic) and injuries. ",,"In 2021, the top 10 causes of death accounted for 39 million deaths, or 57% of the total 68 million deaths worldwide. The top global causes of death, in order of total number of lives lost, are associated with two broad topics: cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease, stroke) and respiratory (COVID-19, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections), with COVID-19 emerging as the second leading causes of death globally. ","COVID-19 has highlighted the importance for countries investing in civil registration and vital statistics systems to allow daily counting of deaths and direct prevention and treatment efforts. It has also revealed inherent fragmentation in data collection systems in most low-income countries, where policy-makers still do not know with confidence how many people die and of what causes. The World Health Organization develops standards and best practices for data collection, processing and synthesis through the consolidated and improved International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). This digital platform facilitates reporting of timely and accurate data for causes of death for countries to routinely generate and use health information that conforms to international standards.

Tobacco,"Key facts Tobacco kills up to half of its users who don’t quit (1–3). Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year, including an estimated 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke (4). ",,"Around 80% of the 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest. Tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco. This spending behaviour is difficult to curb because tobacco is so addictive. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the lost human capital that results from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality. ",Over a quarter of the world's population living in 74 countries are protected by comprehensive national smoke-free laws. More on second-hand smoke ,The WHO MPOWER measures are in line with the WHO FCTC and have been shown to save lives and reduce costs from averted healthcare expenditure. Overview ,The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade of Tobacco Products (ITP) is the key supply side policy to reduce tobacco use and its health and economic consequences. More on eliminating the illicit trade of tobacco products 
Trachoma,Key facts ,"Symptoms and transmission In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates which can be as high as 60–90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infection is usually acquired when living in close proximity to others with active disease, and the family is the main setting for transmission. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. ",Trachoma is a disease of the eye caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a public health problem in 38 countries and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. ,Prevention and control Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy. This consists of: ,"In 2023, 130 746 people received surgical treatment for advanced stage of the disease, and 32.9 million people were treated with antibiotics. Global antibiotic coverage in 2023 was 29%. Overview ","Economic impact The burden of trachoma on affected individuals and communities is enormous. The economic cost in terms of lost productivity from blindness and visual impairment is estimated at US$ 2.9–5.3 billion annually, increasing to US$ 8 billion when trichiasis is included. "
Trans fat,"Key facts Trans fat, or trans-fatty acids (TFA), are unsaturated fatty acids that come from either industrial or natural sources. More than 278 000 deaths each year globally can be attributed to intake of industrially produced trans fat. Overview ",,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the world. Major risk factors are unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use. Among other dietary factors, high intake of trans fat increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by 21%. Trans fat has no known health benefits. Trans fat is produced industrially by the partial hydrogenation of any liquid oils, in most cases vegetable oils, but also occurs naturally in meat and dairy products from ruminant animals. For a healthy diet, the recommended intake of trans-fats is less than 1% of total energy. Industrially produced trans fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided. ","Although the primary responsibility to protect citizens from the harmful effects of industrially produced trans fat rests with governments, there are actions that individuals can take too to reduce trans fact intake: intake: avoid PHO found in fried and baked foods (if it is labelled on the food product) ",,
Trichomoniasis,Key facts Overview ,"Symptoms Trichomoniasis infection in women may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Vaginal discharge is the main symptom that women may present, and can be accompanied by itch, pain when urinating and pain during intercourse. In men, most infections are asymptomatic but some experience penile discharge or pain when urinating. ","Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) among women of reproductive age, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. It is treatable and curable. ",Trichomonas vaginalis is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted protozoan that infects the urogenital tract. More than 50% of women with Trichomonas vaginalis infection have vaginal discharge and about 10% of men have urethritis or urethral discharge. ,"Healthcare providers will discuss the patient’s medical and sexual history and conduct a genital examination, including speculum examination and palpation, to enable them to have important clues to clinical diagnosis. Diagnostic options include smear microscopy and antigen or molecular testing. The latter include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), considered in some settings as a gold standard for diagnosing T. vaginalis. These can be performed in the lab. Vaginal or endocervical specimens are the preferred specimen type for diagnostic testing. In many primary healthcare settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting T. vaginalis is not available, a syndromic approach for case management is recommended. ",
"Trypanosomiasis, human African (sleeping sickness)",Overview ,"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, found in 24 countries of west and central Africa, currently accounts for 92% of reported cases and causes a chronic illness. A person can be infected for months or even years without major signs or symptoms. When evident symptoms emerge, often the disease is advanced with the central nervous system already affected. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, found in 13 countries of eastern and southern Africa accounts for 8% of reported cases and causes an acute disease. First signs and symptoms emerge a few weeks or months after infection. The disease develops rapidly with multi-organ invasion, including the brain. ","Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease. It is caused by protozoans of the genus Trypanosoma, transmitted to humans by bites of tsetse flies (glossina) which have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Tsetse flies inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and only certain species transmit the disease. Rural populations which depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are the most exposed. In many regions where tsetse flies are found, HAT is not. The disease has a focal distribution ranging from single villages to entire regions, and the incidence can vary from one village to the next. ",,"HAT threatens mainly populations of remote rural areas with limited health services, which complicates its diagnosis and treatment. These populations are also affected by war, displacement and poverty, factors favoring transmission. Several epidemics occurred over the last century: ","mechanical transmission by other blood-sucking insects is possible, although its epidemiological impact is likely marginal; accidental infection in laboratories via pricks with contaminated needles; and "
Tuberculosis,Key facts Overview ,About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease. Those who are infected but free of disease cannot transmit it. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment. ,"A total of 1.25 million people died from tuberculosis (TB) in 2023 (including 161 000 people with HIV). Worldwide, TB has probably returned to being the world’s leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following three years in which it was replaced by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It was also the leading killer of people with HIV and a major cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance. In 2023, an estimated 10.8 million people fell ill with TB worldwide, including 6.0 million men, 3.6 million women and 1.3 million children. TB is present in all countries and age groups. TB is curable and preventable. ","US$ 22 billion is needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve the global target by 2027 agreed at the 2023 UN high level-meeting on TB. Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ",Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2023. Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 79 million lives since the year 2000. ,"Impact TB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. "
Tungiasis,Overview ,"Signs and symptoms Tungiasis is diagnosed by visual inspection, the live fleas appearing as a whitish disc varying in size with a dark point in the middle that darkens with time until dead and entirely black. In areas where the disease is endemic, affected individuals, even children, typically know whether they have tungiasis. Most affected individuals attempt to extract the fleas, leaving a typical circular lesion, often with the blackened remains of the dead flea. This is a clear indication of recent infection. ","Tungiasis is caused by the adult female sand flea, Tunga penetrans. The larvae and pupae develop in dry shaded soils, mostly inside the sleeping rooms of houses with an unsealed earthen floor where most transmission occurs. The embedded flea causes inflammation, pain and itching, difficulty walking, sleeping and concentrating on school or work. Tungiasis is a zoonosis that affects humans and animals alike. The only product shown to have high efficacy and safety for treatment is NYDA®, a combination of dimeticone oils. Control will require a One Health approach, treating the patients as well as spraying floors with insecticide or sealing them, daily foot washing with soap, and treating any infected animals owned by affected families. ","Prevention and control The major risk factor for tungiasis is extreme poverty, which drives behaviour that puts people at risk for infection. This includes living in a house with an unsealed earthen floor not washing feet regularly and not using soap when washing. In some communities, infection is also linked to ownership of dogs or pigs. ","Treatment In endemic areas, mechanical extraction of burrowed sand fleas is common as an act of despair. This is usually done by the patients themselves or a caregiver. Embedded parasites are removed under non-sterile conditions using instruments such as sticks, hair pins, thorns, safety pins, sewing needles or scissors. The procedure is painful and traumatizes children. Removing the fleas can cause local inflammation if the parasite ruptures and introduces pathogenic bacteria, leading to further superinfection of the sore. The instrument is often subsequently used on several people, which risks transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or even HIV. ","Impact The embedded flea induces inflammation associated with immense pain and itching. This disturbs sleep and concentration on school or work. Patients with large numbers of embedded fleas have difficulty walking, often with loss of nails and disfigured and mutilated feet. People with tungiasis experience stigma and social exclusion and a low quality of life. Children with tungiasis have cognitive impairment and lower school exam scores. Impaired physical fitness of adult household members could have a negative impact on household economics. Bacterial superinfection may cause life-threatening complications, such as septicaemia, tetanus or gangrene. "
Typhoid,Overview ,"Symptoms Salmonella Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be confirmed through blood testing. ","Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are ingested, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream. Urbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread in communities that lack access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation. ","Prevention Typhoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective in preventing typhoid fever. ",Treatment Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics.  Antimicrobial resistance is common with likelihood of more complicated and expensive treatment options required in the most affected regions. ,
Ultraviolet radiation,"Overview Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can neither be seen nor felt. While some people are exposed to artificial UVR sources (e.g. in medicine, industry and for disinfection and cosmetic purposes), everyone is exposed to solar UVR. Solar UVR levels are influenced by several factors: Sun elevation: the higher the sun in the sky, the higher the UVR level. UVR levels vary with time of day and time of year. ",,"Acute effects of UVR include DNA damage, sunburn, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, and suppression of the immune system. Immunosuppression can be considered as a risk factor for cancer and can cause reactivation of viruses (e.g. cold sores in the lip). Chronic effects on skin and lips from UVR exposure include: ","Acute effects of UVR include photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis (inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, respectively). These effects are reversible, easily prevented by protective eyewear and are not usually associated with any long-term damage but are painful and might require therapeutic intervention. Chronic effects of UVR include: ","UVR in small amounts is essential to good health as it leads to the production of vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D strengthens the bone and musculoskeletal system. People who have very low sun exposure – such as those in institutional care or housebound, people with deeply pigmented skin living in high latitudes or those who, for religious or cultural reasons cover their entire body surface when they are outdoors – should consider oral vitamin D supplementation. People at particular risk ","Climate change, including through variations in ozone and cloud cover, is expected to impact UVR levels at the Earth’s surface. Health effects "
Universal health coverage (UHC),"Key facts The world is off track to make significant progress towards universal health coverage (Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target 3.8) by 2030. Improvements to health services coverage have stagnated since 2015, and the proportion of the population that faced catastrophic levels of out-of-pocket health spending increased continuously since 2000. This global pattern is consistent across all regions and the majority of countries. The UHC service coverage index increased from 45 to 68 between 2000 and 2021. However, recent progress in increasing coverage has slowed compared to pre-2015 gains, rising only 3 index points between 2015 and 2021 and showing no change since 2019. ",,"Protecting people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets reduces the risk that people will be pushed into poverty because the cost of needed services and treatments requires them to use up their life savings, sell assets, or borrow – destroying their futures and often those of their children. Achieving UHC is one of the targets the nations of the world set when they adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. At the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on UHC in 2019, countries reaffirmed that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work aims to have 1 billion more people benefit from UHC by 2025, while also contributing to the targets of 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies and 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being. ","Universal health coverage (UHC) means that all people have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care across the life course. The delivery of these services requires health and care workers with an optimal skills mix at all levels of the health system, who are equitably distributed, adequately supported with access to quality assured products, and enjoying decent work. ","To build back better, WHO’s recommendation is to reorient health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Scaling up PHC interventions across low and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030. ","At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, essential services were disrupted in 92% of countries. In 2022, 84% of countries still reported disruptions. In 2021, some 25 million children under 5 years missed out on routine immunization. There were glaring disparities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, with an average of 34% of the population vaccinated in low-income countries compared to almost 73% in high-income countries as of June 2023. Potentially life-saving emergency, critical and operative care interventions also showed increased service disruptions, likely resulting in significant near-term impact on health outcomes. As a foundation for and way to move towards UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. PHC is the most inclusive, equitable, cost-effective and efficient approach to enhance people’s physical and mental health, as well as social well-being. It enables universal, integrated access to health services as close as possible to people’s everyday environments. It also helps deliver the full range of quality services and products that people need for health and well-being, thereby improving coverage and financial protection. Significant cost efficiencies can be achieved and most (90%) essential UHC interventions can be delivered through a PHC approach. Some 75% of the projected health gains from the SDGs could also be realized through PHC, including saving over 60 million lives and increasing average global life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030. "
Urban health,Key facts Over 55% of the world’s population live in urban areas and this is set to rise to 68% by 2050. Almost 40% of urban dwellers have no access to safely managed sanitation services and many lack access to adequate drinking water. Overview ,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic showed that cities often bear the brunt of emergencies. Citizens frequently have high exposure to the virus and have no space or the means to protect themselves. Overcrowding and lack of clean sanitation services increase the risk of contagion, limit residents’ ability to adhere to public health measures and increase the likelihood of interpersonal violence. Around the globe, COVID-19 spread quickly in areas with other existing health inequities, such as the unfair and preventable differences in people’s health, well-being and access to quality health services. COVID-19 cases and deaths in deprived areas were double those of more advantaged areas. WHO response ","Infectious diseases like COVID-19, tuberculosis, dengue and diarrhoea thrive in poor and overcrowded environments and are closely related to unhealthy housing and poor sanitation and waste management. Poor urban waste management fuels transmission of diseases such as the Zika and Ebola viruses. Health inequities in urban areas ","While urbanization can bring health and economic benefits, rapid and unplanned urbanization can have many negative social and environmental health impacts, which hit the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest. Health inequities are perhaps most stark in urban areas, sometimes varying from street to street. Migrants and other disadvantaged groups tend to be clustered in the most deprived and environmentally degraded neighbourhoods with the fewest mobility, work and educational opportunities, the poorest access to health services and below average health outcomes. Urban health and climate change "
Vector-borne diseases,Key facts ,,"Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700 000 deaths annually. They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses. Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by Anopheline mosquitoes. It causes an estimated 249 million cases globally, and results in more than 608 000 deaths every year. Most of the deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years. ",Many of vector-borne diseases are preventable through protective measures and community mobilization. Overview ,"providing training (capacity building) on clinical management, diagnosis and vector control with support from some of its collaborating centres; and supporting the development and evaluation of new tools, technologies and approaches for vector-borne diseases, including vector control and disease management technologies.

Violence against children,Types of violence against children Most violence against children involves at least one of six main types of interpersonal violence that tend to occur at different stages in a child’s development. ,,"When directed against girls or boys because of their biological sex or gender identity, any of these types of violence can also constitute gender-based violence. Impact of violence ",absent or inadequate social protection post-conflict situations or natural disaster ,"Maltreatment (including violent punishment) involves physical, sexual and psychological/emotional violence; and neglect of infants, children and adolescents by parents, caregivers and other authority figures, most often in the home but also in settings such as schools and orphanages. Bullying (including cyber-bullying) is unwanted aggressive behaviour by another child or group of children who are neither siblings nor in a romantic relationship with the victim. It involves repeated physical, psychological or social harm, and often takes place in schools and other settings where children gather, and online. ","Violence against children has lifelong impacts on health and well-being of children, families, communities, and nations. Violence against children can: Result in death. Homicide, which often involves weapons such as knives and firearms, is among the top four causes of death in adolescents, with boys comprising over 80% of victims and perpetrators. "
Violence against women,"Overview The United Nations defines violence against women as ""any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life"" (1). ",,"Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours. Sexual violence is ""any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object, attempted rape, unwanted sexual touching and other non-contact forms."" ","Intimate partner and sexual violence is the result of factors occurring at individual, family, community and wider society levels that interact with each other to increase or reduce risk (protective). Some are associated with being a perpetrator of violence, some are associated with experiencing violence and some are associated with both. Risk factors for both intimate partner and sexual violence include: ",a history of exposure to child maltreatment (perpetration and experience); witnessing family violence (perpetration and experience); ,"Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic impacts have increased the exposure of women to abusive partners and known risk factors, while limiting their access to services. Situations of humanitarian crises and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as by intimate partners, as well as non-partner sexual violence, and may also lead to new forms of violence against women. COVID-19 and violence against women "
West Nile virus,Outbreaks ,"Signs and symptoms Infection with WNV is either asymptomatic (no symptoms) in around 80% of infected people, or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease. ","West Nile Virus (WNV) can cause neurological disease and death in people. WNV is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. WNV is maintained in nature in a cycle involving transmission between birds and mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected. West Nile Virus (WNV) is a member of the flavivirus genus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family Flaviviridae. ","Treatment is supportive for patients with neuro-invasive West Nile virus, often involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections. No vaccine is available for humans. Vector and animal hosts ","To date, no human-to-human transmission of WNV through casual contact has been documented, and no transmission of WNV to health care workers has been reported when standard infection control precautions have been put in place. Transmission of WNV to laboratory workers has been reported. ",
White phosphorus,"Key facts White phosphorus is a chemical waxy solid substance typically appearing yellowish or colourless, and some have described its odour as resembling garlic. It ignites instantly upon contact with oxygen. It is often used by militaries to illuminate battlefields, to generate a smokescreen and as an incendiary. ",,"White phosphorus can cause deep and severe burns, penetrating even through bone. After exposure, the priority is to stop the burning process. Caution must be exercised to avoid secondary exposure of medical personnel from victims suffering from white phosphorus burns. White phosphorus can re-ignite during or after initial treatment due to the contact with oxygen. Use clean water/medically prepared saline throughout the process. Overview ","Care should be taken not to expose others when removing phosphorus particles. Since white phosphorus can spontaneously ignite, care should be taken to prevent exposure to all sources of ignition such as naked flames, electrical equipment, and the smoking of tobacco products. Remove the patient from exposure, then carefully remove the patient’s clothes and personal effects. Bear in mind that contaminated clothing can ignite or reignite; therefore, contaminated items should be placed in a water-filled closable container that is clearly labelled as a hazard. Rinse and irrigate the skin with cool water and keep exposed areas wet to stop ignition, e.g. by covering with wet cloths, during transportation to the treatment unit. ","Management of exposure After exposure, the priority is to stop the burning process. The care providers should be aware of the risk and should have immediate access to clean water or medically prepared saline water prior to starting the treatment. Use the following guidance when providing care to a person who has been exposed to white phosphorous: ",
Yaws,Overview ,"Signs and symptoms Yaws initially presents as a papilloma (a wart-like tumour) teemed with bacteria, which makes clinical diagnosis straightforward. Without treatment, the papilloma will ulcerate. The diagnosis of the ulcerative form is more challenging and requires serological confirmation. Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to others. Other clinical forms of yaws exist but they are not as infectious. ","Yaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus Treponema, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these 3 infections. The organism that causes yaws, Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, is closely related genetically to T. pallidum subspecies pallidum, which causes syphilis, bejel and pinta. ",Prevention and control There is no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improvement in personal hygiene are essential components to reduce transmission. Contacts of patients with yaws should receive empiric treatment. ,"About 75–80% of people affected by yaws are children under 15 years of age. Peak incidence occurs in children aged 6–10 years, and males and females are equally affected. Transmission is through person-to-person contact of minor injuries. The initial lesion of yaws is teemed with the bacteria. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The incubation period is 9–90 days, with an average of 21 days. Without treatment, infection can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability. WHO classifies countries into three epidemiological groups. ",
Yellow fever,Overview ,"Symptoms The incubation period for yellow fever is 3 to 6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms. Common symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. ","Yellow fever is an epidemic-prone mosquito-borne vaccine preventable disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Yellow fever is caused by an arbovirus (a virus transmitted by vectors such mosquitoes, ticks or other arthropods) transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. These day-biting mosquitoes breed around houses (domestic), in forests or jungles (sylvatic), or in both habitats (semi-domestic). Yellow fever is a high-impact high-threat disease, with risk of international spread, which represents a potential threat to global health security. ",Prevention 1. Vaccination ,"Treatment There is no specific anti-viral drug for yellow fever. Patients should rest, stay hydrated and seek medical advice. Depending on the clinical manifestations and other circumstances, patients may be sent home, be referred for in-hospital management, or require emergency treatment and urgent referral. Treatment for dehydration, liver and kidney failure, and fever improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. ",Garske T. et al.

Youth violence,"Key facts Worldwide about 193 000 homicides occur among youth 15–29 years of age each year, which is 40% of the total number of homicides globally each year. ",,"Homicide is among the leading cause of death in people aged 15–29 years, and the vast majority of homicides involve male victims. For each young person killed, many more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment. ","the quality of a country’s governance (its laws and the extent to which they are enforced, as well as policies for education and social protection). Prevention ","For every young person killed by violence, more sustain injuries that require hospital treatment. Firearm attacks end more often in fatal injuries than assaults that involve fists, feet, knives and blunt objects. Sexual violence also affects a significant proportion of youth. For example, 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 7 boys report sexual abuse (1). ","When it is not fatal, youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's physical, psychological and social functioning. Overview "
Zika virus,"Overview Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus first identified in Uganda in 1947 in a Rhesus macaque monkey followed by evidence of infection and disease in humans in other African countries in the 1950s. From the 1960s to 1980s, sporadic human infections were detected across Africa and Asia. However, since 2007 outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. ","Symptoms Most people infected with Zika virus do not develop symptoms. Among those who do, they typically start 3–14 days after infection, are generally mild including rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise and headache, and usually last for 2–7 days. These symptoms are common to other arboviral and non-arboviral diseases; thus, the diagnosis of Zika virus infection requires laboratory confirmation. ","Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant, including limb contractures, high muscle tone, eye abnormalities and hearing loss. These clinical features are collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome. The risk of congenital malformations following infection in pregnancy remains unknown; an estimated 5–15% of infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy have evidence of Zika-related complications (3). Congenital malformations occur following both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Zika infection in pregnancy can also cause complications such as fetal loss, stillbirth and preterm birth. ","Research is ongoing to investigate the risk and effects of Zika virus infection on pregnancy outcomes, strategies for prevention and control, and effects of infection on other neurological disorders in children and adults. Questions and answers: Zika virus and complications ",Treatment There is no specific treatment available for Zika virus infection or disease. ,
Zoonoses,,,"A zoonosis is an infectious disease that has jumped from a non-human animal to humans. Zoonotic pathogens may be bacterial, viral or parasitic, or may involve unconventional agents and can spread to humans through direct contact or through food, water or the environment. They represent a major public health problem around the world due to our close relationship with animals in agriculture, as companions and in the natural environment. Zoonoses can also cause disruptions in the production and trade of animal products for food and other uses. Zoonoses comprise a large percentage of all newly identified infectious diseases as well as many existing ones. Some diseases, such as HIV, begin as a zoonosis but later mutate into human-only strains. Other zoonoses can cause recurring disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis. Still others, such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, have the potential to cause global pandemics. ","Prevention and control Prevention methods for zoonotic diseases differ for each pathogen; however, several practices are recognized as effective in reducing risk at the community and personal levels. Safe and appropriate guidelines for animal care in the agricultural sector help to reduce the potential for foodborne zoonotic disease outbreaks through foods such as meat, eggs, dairy or even some vegetables. Standards for clean drinking water and waste removal, as well as protections for surface water in the natural environment, are also important and effective. Education campaigns to promote handwashing after contact with animals and other behavioural adjustments can reduce community spread of zoonotic diseases when they occur. ",,"WHO works with national governments, academia, non-governmental and philanthropic organizations, and regional and international partners to prevent and manage zoonotic threats and their public health, social and economic impacts. These efforts include fostering cross-sectoral collaboration at the human-animal-environment interface among the different relevant sectors at regional, national and international levels. WHO also works to develop capacity and promote practical, evidence-based and cost-effective tools and mechanisms for zoonoses prevention, surveillance and detection through reporting, epidemiological and laboratory investigation, risk assessment and control, and assisting countries in their implementation. As part of the One Health approach, the World Health Organization collaborates with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on the Global Early Warning System for Major Animal Diseases (GLEWS). This joint system builds on the added value of combining and coordinating alert mechanisms of the three agencies to assist in early warning, prevention and control of animal disease threats, including zoonoses, through data sharing and risk assessment.
